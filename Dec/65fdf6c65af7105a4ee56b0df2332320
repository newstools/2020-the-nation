Many adults who endured violence while growing up have had to deal with a broad spectrum of childhood traumas.Teenhood comes with a deep exploration of boundaries, thoughts, ideas, perceptions and experiences, which eventually helps in the growth of a teen. There’s a generation that was raised in households that silenced and punished teenhood out of them. Their expressions and desires were completely shut down.
This out-of-the-norm existence that teenagers naturally pursue is what is falsely interpreted as improper behaviour and is thus punished out of them. Additionally, teens are constantly reminded of not knowing anything and spoken to in a tone that reminds them how awful they are.

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});

}



This particular generation was raised by parents who punished anything that was too difficult to process out of their children, which is why we must re-examine ways of engaging teenhood without making it look like a punitive phase of growing up.
Parenting models
Society was vastly different then, with parenting models that used violence, which makes it seem as though those who grew up with the violence are well-behaved, but that is not necessarily true.





Many adults who endured violence while growing up have had to deal with a broad spectrum of childhood traumas.
We have to start from understanding that being a teenager comes with an incessant inclination to explore. Teenhood comes with a deep exploration of boundaries, thoughts, ideas, perceptions and experiences, which eventually helps in the growth of a teen. However, the world is dark with lurking danger, which means that foremost, we must collectively create safe societies for teens to be teens. Being a teenager shouldn’t be a dangerous phase of secret endeavours and if it is, it points towards the gaps in society’s moral fabric.
Secondly, if we are going to create a new society for teens to grow up in, we must be willing to think differently as adults regarding teenhood. This requires us to have a contextual understanding that allows us to engage honestly with the challenges of both, playing a parenting role and being a teen in an interconnected world.

googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-2");

Wayward
 The internet escalates the misgivings of teenhood, compounds the role of parenting and enhances the danger that befalls teenagers. And yes, technology makes it seem as though the current group of teens are from a different planet, which is neither new nor unique.
What is new is the context teenagers find themselves in and are forced to engage with without adequate information or tools. Thirdly, before we are quick to vilify and label teens wayward, we owe them understanding.
We must listen to teens and give them understanding drawn from references of imperfections and complexities of growing up, and what this looks like with the internet in play. Fourth, we need to teach teens, with minimal to no biases, age-appropriate sexual education at home and in schools so they don’t live in angst over curiosities that make them easy prey.
Cultivating healthy spaces for conversations about teenhood that hold no judgement for teen curiosity is a great place to start. So instead of being quick to sensationalise teenagers, maybe we should start having honest dialogues on the nuances of growing up.
