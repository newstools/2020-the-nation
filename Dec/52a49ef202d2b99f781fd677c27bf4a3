Deputy President William Ruto's allies have accused security officers of siding with their rivals in the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) and letting them bribe and intimidate voters during the Msambweni by-election.
They did not give evidence to support their claims, but former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama, who is DP Ruto's ally, was arrested in the constituency on allegations of causing a disturbance.

Addressing journalists at Leopard Beach Hotel in Diani on Tuesday, Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi claimed police officers had been instructed to arrest them.
Mr Sudi said they narrowly escaped arrest at Zero Zero in Kinondo Ward where police had erected a road block.
He claimed they are after Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani, who is the chief agent representing independent candidate Feisal Bader.
The politicians were trailed by police immediately after accompanying Mr Bader to the Gazi Primary School polling station to cast his vote.

Nyali MP Mohamed Ali also alleged that leaders allied to DP Ruto are being targeted by police in a bid to prevent them from monitoring the vote.
Mr Mwashetani concurred with him.
MPs Kimani Ichung'wa' (Kikuyu), Nixon Korir (Lang'ata) and Aisha Jumwa (Malindi) also attended the press briefing.

Scuffle
There was a commotion at the Mwaroni polling station, where Mr Bader’s supporters led by Nyali MP Mohamed Ali clashed with people they said were goons.
An official from Muslims for Human Rights (Muhuri) said the MP caused tension when he arrived in a convoy of about 10 cars.
A witness who identified himself only as Bakari said that at around 7.45am, the alleged goons roughed up a voter, claiming he was bribing others, and took a phone and a wallet.

The witness said one of the men slapped another voter, who was standing outside the polling station.
A scuffle ensued but Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir intervened when he arrived and demanded the return of the phone and wallet to the owner. Only the wallet was returned, according to a Muhuri official.
Kwale County Police Commander Joseph Nthenge said investigations had been launched.
"If the person who was assaulted has reported the matter to police, we will take action," he said.
Mr Ali later recorded a statement at Diani Police Station, saying he was attacked and his car damaged.

“Propaganda”
Speaking after voting at 8am, ODM candidate Omar Boga accused Mr Ali of causing tension at the polling station.
"We are aware that they are creating tension in my strongholds so that people do not turn up. I assure my people that the situation is under control. Police have assured us of total security,” Mr Boga said at Jogoo grounds.
"There is a lot of propaganda. We heard that people will be ferried from as far as Malindi to disrupt the election but we hope everything goes smoothly because the people of Msambweni want a leader elected democratically.”
The politician added that some agents were denied access to polling centres and that there was a problem with the badges used to identify them.

Constituency Returning Officer Yusuf Abubakar said the issues resulted from non-compliance with regulations.
"We have resolved many of them ... everything is now moving smoothly. Some agents had been sent directly to the stations before going through our officials, hence the delay," he said. The former Machakos senator is accused of causing a disturbance. The constituency has been without a member of Parliament since March following the death of Suleiman Dori The Uganda Communications Commission says the channels were used to mobilise riots in November that resulted in many deaths. Residents report seeing SNA troops taking strategic positions along the border. Kenyan Uber drivers say their investments have gone down the drain.
