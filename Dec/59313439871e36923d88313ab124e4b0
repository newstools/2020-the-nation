Police say that the two persons might have died of Covid-19 complications.A post-mortem report from the government pathologist differs. In a twist of fate, two men who were arrested for flouting the 10pm curfew died after spending a night in police cells in Kirinyaga County.
But while police say that the two, Martin Musyoka, 58, and John Njeru, 28, might have died of Covid-19 complications, a post-mortem report from the government pathologist differs, saying the pair died of either internal injuries or lack of oxygen.

It all started on November 20 this year when the two villagers were detained during a crackdown on people who were flouting curfew rules imposed by the government to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in Kirinyaga County.
The villagers were seized in Mikimaini and Thiba villages in Mwea East Sub-County and locked up at Wang'uru police station.
However, the following day they collapsed in the cells as they waited to be arraigned in court and were rushed to Kimbimbi Sub-County Hospital where they died during treatment.

});
}, 62000);
}



Moments later, police said that the two might have succumbed to the Covid-19 disease.
The county police commander Leah Kithei told the media that the remand prisoners fell sick when they were at the station and were taken to hospital.
She dismissed claims by relatives that they had been assaulted while in the cells.
She also denied claims that the duo was in crowded cells and might, therefore, have suffocated to death.
Mwea East Sub-County police head Daniel Kitavi also denied that the two villagers had been attacked at the station.
He said the villagers were among five remand prisoners who were found ailing in the cells.
"The two remand prisoners succumbed while being treated and we suspected they died of Covid-19 because they complained of difficulty in breathing," said Mr Kitavi.

});
}, 62000);
}



Mr Kitavi said that as soon as the remand prisoners collapsed, the local multi-sectoral Covid-19 committee met to discuss the matter.
However, a post-mortem report revealed that the suspects could have died of injuries inflicted at the police station or lack of sufficient oxygen due to congestion.
The revelation now puts the police in a spot.
Internal injuries 
Government Chief Pathologist Dr Johansen Oduor disapproved the police theory that Covid-19 claimed the lives of the pair.
According to Dr Oduor, who performed the autopsy at the Kerugoya Referral Hospital mortuary, both victims had internal head and stomach injuries and lacked enough oxygen.
"The victims could have succumbed to injuries they suffered at the police station or insufficient oxygen occasioned by congestion in the cells," he told reporters.
Dr Oduor said investigations have started to establish who fatally attacked the victims while in police custody.
Following the post-mortem, families of the two villagers are now crying out for justice.
Mr Musyoka’s first widow, Jeniffer Njeri, said she was shocked to learn that her husband did not lose his life to Covid-19 as had been alleged by the police.
"It has now been established beyond any reasonable doubt that my husband died after being attacked at the police station. He had injuries on the legs, hands and head. Those responsible for the death of my husband should be arrested and prosecuted," she said.

Ms Njeri said it would be very difficult for her and her co-wife to provide for their nine children.
"Mr Musyoka, who was a mechanic, was the sole breadwinner for our family and we shall surely suffer following his demise," she added.
And Ms Loise Nyawira said Mr Njeru, her son, worked as a boda-boda rider in Thiba Village. He is survived by a wife and one child.
"Sadly, officers who are entrusted to protect our children are the ones who are turning against them," said Ms Nyawira.
She said officers implicated in the death of her son should not go unpunished.
The families said the two victims were in the local market at night when they were seized by the officers for allegedly flouting curfew rules and booked at the station.
"At first, we were told they suffered from Covid-19 which later killed them. We doubted the police information because their bodies had serious injuries," said Ms Nyawira.
The families said they had obtained results of Covid-19 tests on their relatives, which indicated that they were free from the disease.
"We have the results which show that our relatives were not sick," Ms Nyawira said. Ezekiel Oduor Okiru, 20, was allegedly shot by police on patrol on Friday night for not wearing a mask. Suspects were released on cash bail and are expected to appear in courts today. Residents of Mombasa have been eagerly waiting the commissioning of the bridge. Ms Nthenya was freed without any charges being preferred against her. Just last week, Justice James Rika recused himself from the case after tempers flared in court.
