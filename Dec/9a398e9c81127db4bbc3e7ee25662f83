Once again, we are in the throes of industrial action in the health sector. The nurses and clinical officers declared strikes starting this past week, and the doctors suspended theirs for two more weeks to allow for consultations.
Since the registration of the doctors’ union, December strikes have become almost de rigueur. Unfortunately, there is also little variation in the grievances leading up to the strikes, and perhaps it is time we spent a little time interrogating the reasons behind the frequent strikes.

A perennial complaint is that an aspect or other of remuneration has been neglected or ignored, and the workers are going on strike to enforce an old agreement on remuneration or salary increment. Industrial relations practice does not anticipate that a reality can exist in which an employer enters an agreement with an employee and fails to keep their end of the bargain.

Indeed, industrial harmony is only maintained on the premise that each party in the tripartite arrangement will keep their end of the bargain, and that courts exist to enforce the rights of any of the parties that might feel wronged.
Unfortunately, as we continue to wallow in the confusion inherent in our constitutional transition and our experiment with democratic governance, we are encountering instances where employers are entering agreements they either have no capacity to implement, or employees are pushing for agreements they know will not be implemented.
Collective bargaining agreements
The end result is that negotiated collective bargaining agreements are not being implemented, and the industrial relations environment is becoming ever more toxic.
It is my opinion that we need a huge dose of honesty in our industrial relations environment. In order to achieve this, it is important for public sector employers to confront the reality that things changed in 2010.

All workers became eligible to join trade unions, and to negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment. This fact has taken a lot of time to sink in, leading to unnecessarily adversarial labour relations.
Secondly, we must critically interrogate the role of the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC). Over time, we have realised that the commission failed in its original constitutional mission to control the ability of State Officers (who are not eligible to join trade unions) to determine their own pay.
Indeed, the SRC was meant to be the State officer ‘employer’ on behalf of ‘the people’ collectively. The rest of our public officers would join trade unions and negotiate with their employers under the industrial relations regime introduced by the new constitution.
Unfortunately, the SRC has now abdicated from it constitutional responsibility to “set State officers’ pay and advise on other public officers pay”, and now purports to “advise on State officers’ pay and set other public officers’ pay”.
This deliberate misinterpretation of the constitution is at the heart of the reigning industrial unrest in Kenya. If SRC maintained the constitutional boundaries set for it, it would determine without contradiction the pay of our political class, and only provide economic implication advice to public sector employers who would then take full responsibility for their financial decisions.
