Okolla couldn't continue after he sustained two deep cuts from accidental head-butts to hand Mulowayi a technical knockout victory.
Okolla now has 11 wins, four losses while Mulowayi stretched his record to nine wins, two losses and a draw.
"I was actually leading from the first round before the accidental butts ruined things for me. I will not lose hope. It's a title I would like to have. I will focus on preparations since I have another fight in January," said the 38-year-old Okolla, who is the national heavyweight champion.





Okoth appeared to have lost his mouthpiece in the sixth round after a hook from Reshat Mati in their non-title welterweight bout on Friday night in Florida, USA.
Then Mati would cash in on Bilabong's state to unleash fierce combinations forcing the referee to call the stoppage a minute and 18 seconds into the sixth round. The bout was scheduled to last eight rounds.
Bilabong's featured as one of the undercard to Gennadiy "GGG" Golovkin (41-1-1) from Kazakhstan and Kamil Szeremeta (20-1-0) unified International Boxing Federation and International Boxing Organisation World middleweight title bout.
As expected Golovkin dominated the Polish boxer to chalk a seventh round stoppage.
