In their opening match of the season, City Stars beat Nzoia Sugar 2-0 at Narok Stadium. City Stars coach Sanjin Alagic was elated by the win against a tough Bandari side. 
"In their first match they (Bandari) won against Sofapaka and then drew against Tusker. They are a very good club in the Kenya Premier League and so it is a joy to beat them. Next match we will even play better," said the Bosnian.
Bandari coach Ken Odhiambo, who failed to beat his former employers, lamed poor officiating for the loss.

"Some of the calls that were made in the match are exactly opposite of what I know. We lost our chances, they used theirs well though I do not recognise the second goal because it was scored when my players were complaining about the call by the referee to cancel our goal," said Odhiambo. 
After a strong start from both sides, City Stars came close to taking the lead in the in the 19th minute, when unmarked Herit Mungai attempted to beat Bandari goalkeeper Justin Ndikumana with a shot at his far right before Yema Mwana forced the host's goalkeeper Steven Njung'e to a save moments later.
Bandari looked to have taken control of the match and in the 35th minute, William Wadri - who started after coming in as a substitute in their barren draw against Tusker last weekend - was unlucky after his header from Abdallah Hassan's corner went wide.
