President Uhuru Kenyatta has hit out at leaders opposed to the standard gauge railway (SGR) operations, terming them “hypocrites”.
He said those rallying the Coast against the project were only seeking political mileage and did not care for the residents’ welfare.
President Kenyatta said the upgrade of the Mombasa port has seen the facility accommodate additional containers enough for both the train and trucks to transport.

“We used to receive 20 million containers here at the port, but because of the expansion of this facility, we have almost doubled the number.
“All those containers are not being transported by the SGR. Trucks are carrying a majority of them,” he said when he commissioned the Likoni floating bridge on Thursday.
Political bickering
President Kenyatta said the expansion of the port and the SGR had created jobs.

“Please do not allow to be fooled by those who want you to clap for them when they lie to you. Those who are talking against what we have been doing are just hypocrites. Do not let them lie to you.
“We are going to continue to do everything possible to better the lives of our people. Let those who are bickering to continue doing it, for us we will remain focused on what we are doing,” he said, referring to the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).
Mr Kenyatta said BBI would ensure constituencies and counties receive more funds for socio-economic development.
Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, who had accompanied the President in Liwatoni accused some leaders in the region of divisive politics.
