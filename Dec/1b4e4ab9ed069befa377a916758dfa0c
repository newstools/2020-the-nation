Meanwhile, the Africa CDC has urged African countries to reinforce Covid-19 testing, contact tracing and early treatment of cases as the continent seeks to gain more insight about the new variant of SARS-CoV-2.
"Coincidentally, the news of the variant has come when the continent is also experiencing a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, Africa CDC advises that member states reinforce their efforts to increase testing, contact tracing and early treatment of cases," the Africa CDC said in a situation report issued earlier this week.
The Africa CDC, however, stressed that "there is no immediate need to restrict trade and travel across the continent because travellers now require a negative virologic test (PCR or Antigen test) before they can travel."
