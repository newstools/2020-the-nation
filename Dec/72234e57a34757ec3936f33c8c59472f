A Nakuru-based human rights activist has been charged in a Nyahururu court with stealing from a police station.
When he appeared before Nyahururu Senior Resident Magistrate Njeri Mwangi, the activist, Mr Robert Njenga, denied two counts of stealing three trees.
It was alleged that on December 14, 2020 at Kabazi Police Station in Nakuru County, jointly with others who were not before the court, he stole two blue gum trees and an acacia tree, all valued at Sh23,598 which was the property of Kenya Police Service.

He faced an alternative count of handling stolen items.
On December 15, 2020 in Kabazi area in Nakuru County, he was allegedly found with two blue gum trees valued at Sh22,112 that were believed to be stolen goods.
Mr Njenga has, however, accused some unidentified officers at the station of framing him for allegedly fighting impunity at the police station.
