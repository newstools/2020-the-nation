"The Cabinet, Cabinet committees and technical committees will not have any scheduled engagements unless directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta, for urgent business, cases of national emergency or any other exceptional circumstances," he said.
Cabinet members excluding those in the NSC and the National Emergency Response Committee on Coronavirus will be allowed to take leave, subject to the President's approval.

Mr Kinyua assured that government services will continue to be provided effectively.
He added that the Cabinet's 2021 calendar will focus on Kenya's Covid-19 recovery efforts. The plan priorities sectors including urban development and housing, transport, tourism, health, education and social protection. President Kenyatta on Friday took a swipe at the unnamed development partners, saying "nchi ina wenyewe (the country has owners)". Regional leaders are expected to hold a meeting in Djibouti Sunday. DP has borrowed Tanzania’s Chama Cha Mapinduzi model, constituting campaign committees in villages. The legislator suggested that she was being targeted because of her political stand.
