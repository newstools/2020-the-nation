Activist Okiya Omtatah has rushed to court in a bid to stop Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu from taking over as acting Chief Justice once David Maraga retires. 
CJ Maraga is set to officially retire tomorrow after serving as the country’s 14th Chief Justice since October 2016. 
In Mr Omtatah's petition, he argues that DCJ Mwilu is not fit to hold the CJ office because of the corruption allegations leveled against her by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI).
