Tourists come for a chance to see the wildlife, beautiful geographical landscapes and the white sandy beaches, among other impressive experiencesIn recent droughts, such as in 2009/2010, the population of elephants, zebras and wildebeests suffered huge losses in the Maasai Mara. Many aspects of our lives are influenced by the weather. The climate of a region affects its ecosystems, water resources, health and industrial activities, such as tourism.
The environment is important in determining the attractiveness of a region as a holiday destination. Tourists come for a chance to see the wildlife, beautiful geographical landscapes and the white sandy beaches, among other impressive experiences.

The tourism industry is the second largest source of foreign exchange. In 2019, tourism contributed 8.8 per cent to the GDP worth Sh790 billion. It’s responsible for 8.3 per cent of all employment and helps reduce dependence on other sectors such as agriculture.
 However, tourism is vulnerable to the threat of climate change. The causes and consequences of climate change resulting from temperature rise are global in scope, but they manifest themselves differently across the diverse regions of the world.

Tourism destinations
According to a research by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), climate change will affect tourism destinations and their competitiveness.
Climate change is causing alterations in the ecosystems and natural resources needed to sustain the tourism industry, with impacts such as desertification, beach erosion, flooding, saline intrusion, landslides, coral reefs bleaching, rising sea levels, and health related problems.
At the coast, sea levels are expected to rise due to increased precipitation and flooding. Some studies suggest that as much as 17 per cent of Mombasa may be submerged in the near future. A rise in sea levels may create conditions of flooding, erosion, sea water intrusion and increased storm surges.

Consequently, there will be destruction of some tourist sites. This will definitely hamper tourism and lead to a reduction of revenue collection, considering that 65 per cent of the tourists who come to Kenya visit the coastal region.
Drastic action
Further inland, climate shifts have contributed to worsening droughts, which put a strain on the ability of even the most adaptive wildlife to cope.
In recent droughts, such as in 2009/2010, the population of elephants, zebras and wildebeests suffered huge losses in the Maasai Mara. The Kenya Wildlife service had to provide water and hay for wild animals.
These effects on game reserves and national parks, which are the main tourist attractions, will significantly affect tourist arrivals. The increase of the average annual temperature will also likely compromise or eliminate certain ecologically sensitive destinations.
For example, the depletion of glaciers on Mount Kenya and Kilimanjaro will greatly impact tourism given that the two mountains are tourist attractions due to their positions near the equator where no snow would be expected.
Another aspect of climate change that will affect tourism is floods, which affect infrastructure to tourist destinations. In 2011/2012, the road networks to the Maasai Mara were destroyed by floods rendering them impassable. Subsequently, tourist numbers fell.

There is no doubt of the strong relationship between climate change and tourism. Drastic action has to be taken by companies in the tourism sector, individuals and the government if we are to salvage the situation and reduce the effects of climate change on tourism and our way of life in general.
