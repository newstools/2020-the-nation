It is now Dr Ruto’s turn to deputise the President and also to be mocked for being ambiguous.Dr Ruto opined that there is need for talks on whether the referendum should be multiple-choice. Deputy President William Ruto, who obtained a PhD in plant ecology in 2018, is probably familiar with a plant called Citrullus lanatus. It is a crop that does best in hot climates and produces the best yield on moderately moist soils. Laypeople know it simply as watermelon.
There are watermelons in botanical terms and watermelons in political terms, and Dr Ruto’s stance — or lack thereof — on the amendment of the constitution through the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) is quickly earning the watermelon tag.

His utterances have been continuously shifting from the red to the green, and it is hard to tell whether he is for or against the proposed amendments. With former Prime Minister Raila Odinga repeatedly insisting that there is no more room for changes to the amendment bill, Dr Ruto is adamant that the document can be renegotiated, though he has not rejected it outright.





Regardless, some people allied to Dr Ruto have voiced their opposition to the BBI process, leaving a cloud of doubt on what direction he really wants to go.
In 2010, Dr Ruto was on the side that opposed approval of the draft that gave rise to today’s constitution. Then, it was his camp that gave the infamous “watermelon” nickname to the then vice-president Kalonzo Musyoka as they accused him of being outwardly supportive (green) but inwardly opposed to the document (red).
It is a perspective Dr Ruto has repeatedly used on Mr Musyoka, notably in 2016 when he called the ex-VP “the one who doesn’t know right from left and is always in the middle”.
It is now Dr Ruto’s turn to deputise the President and also to be mocked for being ambiguous.
“So, I would plead with the fast learners like Kalonzo Musyoka to bear with us just a bit, so that we can all move together.”

That was Dr Ruto addressing Mr Musyoka at Bomas of Kenya during the recent launch of the BBI report, and you could bet a full Sh20 watermelon slice that the term “fast-learners” had a tinge of irony.
In the preceding sentence, he had said, “We are not all at the same level when it comes to reading. Scientists like myself, we take a bit long because we interrogate things and we want experiments and we do many things.”
Like the typical watermelon that thrives in hot climates, it was hot in Bomas, with heckling and all, as Dr Ruto raised his reservations on the document — a move that some observers would later praise as a show of his bravery and grasp of issues.  Also, Dr Ruto’s star in politics has shone through his heated opposition, first against former President Mwai Kibaki then later towards his ally-turned-foe, Mr Odinga.
It remains to be seen whether he will prosper amid the BBI heat, which appears to be coming to him from different quarters. As evidenced in comments by Kenyans’ on social media as he spoke to Citizen TV on Thursday night, there are Kenyans who think he is shifting too many goalposts and does not have a cogent position.





In that interview, Dr Ruto opined that there is need for talks on whether the referendum should be multiple-choice and versus being a simply “yes” or “no” vote and whether it should be held alongside the next General Election.

“We don’t have to get our way on everything. If we agree, for example, on a multiple choice, it is another way of making sure that even if we didn’t agree on some of the major things, then the people can choose from the buffet that will be presented,” he said.
But with Mr Odinga later telling him to just oppose the referendum rather than keep criticising it, it is hardly likely the plant ecology expert will realise the cross pollination of ideas he is seeking.
And with the watermelon tag fast-catching up on him, it remains to be seen whether there will be any fruitful negotiations with him as the amendment bill enters the next stage.
