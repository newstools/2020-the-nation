Noisy headline writing
I am a regular contributor to your beloved newspaper. I give much credit to your editorial team for panel beating and “marinating” contributors’ articles to make them more presentable, simple and clear. However, I would like to learn more about how your editorial teams select headlines for letters and opinion articles.

I wrote the article which you headlined as “Noisy churches” in the Daily Nation’s ‘The Cutting Edge’ by ‘The Watchman’ column of December 7, 2020. In my article, I avoided using the words “mosques” and “churches”. The headline you chose, “Noisy churches” for the printed article gives the wrong impression I was attacking the churches.
Both mosques and churches are guilty for mounting speakers on top of their buildings and some are located in residential areas. The problem I have is why the editor picked churches and not mosques?





Secondly, my main topic and focus was on the role of umbrella institutions such as oil marketers, manufacturers’ association, media and Inter-Religious Council of Kenya in enforcing codes of conduct that comply with not only industry norms but with the country’s laws thus avoiding micro supervision by the government. Why did the sub topic become the main headline?
I would also like to know the safeguards you have in place when articles touching on Islam lands in the hands of a professing Christian editor or vice versa?
