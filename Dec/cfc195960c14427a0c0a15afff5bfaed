Stringent security measures will be put in place during the much-awaited Msambweni by-election, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has said.
Dr Matiang’i, who was in Kwale on Monday for a security meeting with the county officers, said that enough resources would be put in place to ensure the Dec 15 by-election is conducted peacefully.

“I want to ensure that we are going to provide enough security in the upcoming by-election. As the governor (Kwale’s Salim Mvurya) said that the election would come and go. We should all consider that by being conducting a peaceful exercise,” said Dr Matiang’i.
Dr Matiang’i was accompanied by Mr Mvurya who urged fellow politicians to conduct peaceful campaigns ahead of the next week by-election.
Campaigns for the by-elections have heightened following the presence of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho who is drumming up support for ODM party candidate Omar Boga.





Mr Mvurya is supporting independent candidate Feisal Bader who is also backed by Deputy President William Ruto. The two governors have been trading barbs in the heated campaigns.
Yesterday, while accompanying Dr Matiang’i, Mr Mvurya said there was need for politicians who are conducting their campaigns to base them on uniting people.
“We want everyone to coordinate with the security officers who will be providing security for us during the by-election. This by-election should not be a reason for tension in our county. The polls will come and go,” he said.
He said the residents of Kwale have co-existed without any form of discrimination and “we as politicians should ensure we observe that. We should avoid anything that will bring division amongst us”.

Last week, Human Rights Agenda (Huria), a Kwale-based NGO raised alarm over increased hate speech, which it alleged was being propagated online.
The group called on the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) to focus on the campaigns to prevent the spread of hate-speech.
Opinion poll
Recently, a research by Trends and Insights for Africa research (Tifa) showed that ODM candidate would win the by-election if it was to be held last week.
The report showed that 54 percent of voters would vote for Mr Boga while 29 per cent would vote for Mr Bader.
Ali Hassan Mwakulonda of Peoples Economic Democracy (PED) would come third with nine percent, followed by Mwarere Wamwachai with two percent.
Other candidates in the by-election are Charles Bilali and Mansury Kumaka (Independents), Shee Abdulrahman (Wiper) and Khamis Mwakaonje (United Green Movement).
