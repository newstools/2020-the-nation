Additional world championship points are available to the top five crews through the stage regardless of where they actually finished in the rally.Unlike normal special stage, which is timing to tenth of a second, the timing of Power Stage is to the thousandth of a second. Burundi will stage the final round of its national rally championship this weekend.
The event, which was postponed earlier this month due to the death of a senior member of the Club Automobile du Burundi (CAB), will be run over two days starting on Saturday and finishing on Sunday.
The rally will have 12 competitive stages with the longest being 21.80 kilometres and the shortest 4.40km.

The route is compact but a true test for drivers’ alertness and reliability of cars which will need to be driven flat out without costly errors for one to finish.
While the Kedong Ranch, Hells Gate, Malewa and Loldia sections, within a 40km radius in areas surrounding Naivasha, is a journey to the unknown, Soysambu Conservancy, neighbouring Sleeping Warrior and Elmentaita routes in Gilgil are unpredictable.
The jewel of them all remains the designated Loldia “shakedown”, a 5km loop, 30km down Moi South Road from Naivasha town.
It is the complete postcard of breathtaking geographical features. It consists of plains intertwined with forested rocky patches teeming with wildlife.
