County Trade, Tourism and Cooperatives executive Nicholas Biwott, said Kenya Railways would make one trip from Nairobi to Nanyuki on Fridays and back to the city on Sundays under the deal.
“Today we are making a pilot trip to help us evaluate its viability as we seek to come up with a more regular schedule to the central region,” he said.
The train with a capacity of up to 1,600 passengers per trip will depart from Nairobi at 8am to arrive in Nanyuki at 2pm. It will leave Nanyuki on Sunday at 8am to arrive in the capital city at 2pm.

Maiden trip
The maiden trip started at the Nairobi Central Railway Station making stops along the way in Thika and Chaka.
Commuters travelling from Nairobi to Nanyuki were charged Sh200 fare on second class coaches and between Sh50 and Sh100 for inter-terminus trips that will serve Murang’a, Makuyu, Maragua, Sagana, Karatina, Kiganjo, Chaka and Naromoru stations.
However, talks are underway to review the rates following the initial journey.
“We will meet with Kenya Railways to discuss the rates but today passengers paid Sh200. Being the pilot journey it will advise what the rates will be set at by Kenya Railways,” said Mr Biwott.
Freight rate
In August, Kenya Railways came up with freight rate charges as it resumed operations in Nanyuki town.
