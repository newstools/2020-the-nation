Transport along Molo-Elburgon road in Nakuru County was paralysed for hours on Thursday by youths who were protesting over the poor state of the road.
The angry youths, mostly boda-boda operators, barricaded and lit bonfires along the road.
"We want the area MP Kuria Kimani to come here before we open the road. This road is in poor condition with potholes all over," said one of the protesters.

Speaking to the Nation, the youths blamed Mr Kimani for the poor state of the road which joins the busy Nakuru- Kericho highway at Mau Summit junction.
Some of the youths dug a wide tunnel along Radi-Sagaitim road which is commonly used by farmers to collect their farm produce from the farms while others blocked Njoro-Elburgon road with stones and twigs.
The youths were later dispersed after police officers arrived and cleared the road.

But the residents said they will continue protesting until their grievances are heard.
"We recently protested along Radi-Sagaitim road and it was repaired. Let the MP come on the ground and take action," said another resident by the name, John Karanja, who claimed the MP rarely visits the area.
He said a boda-boda operator was recently injured after a vehicle hit a pothole and veered off the road.
The road has become impassable due to numerous potholes, especially in Molo and Elburgon areas. Many of the 3,508 deaths have occurred on these roads Kiraitu says the national government will build a new bridge at a cost of Sh100 million. His family says he had difficulty breathing after his lungs collapsed. President Kenyatta says the Nyamira governor was development-conscious and a key figure in the growth of Kenya's tea sector. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i was among leaders who went to Lee Funeral Home to condole with the family.
