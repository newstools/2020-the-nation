A good number from the disciplined forces are also expected to participate as part of preparations for their championships early next year.
Athletics Kenya Central Rift chairman Abraham Mutai, is optimistic of a huge turnout given it’s the first event in the North Rift since coronavirus broke out in March.
“Athletes have been out for a long time and we are happy that sport is resuming slowly. We expect a good number because most of them have been training alone at home which is a good initiative,” said Mutai.
The first leg was held in Machakos County last month with Simiu winning the senior men's category after timing 28:27.7 ahead of Isaac Kibet who clocked 28:54.6 while Elvis Cheboi was third in 28:54.9.
In the women's category, world cross country champion Hellen Obiri led in 32:29.2 beating Caroline Nyaga who crossed the line in 32:46.8 while Winfred Mutile settled for third in 32:47.5.

Obiri said she will not be competing in the race but will be preparing for the next event which shall be held in January in Olkalau, Nyandarua County.
AK President Jack Tuwei said elite athletes should participate in such events in preparation for a busy 2021 calendar.
“We have a busy season next year and I would like to encourage elite and upcoming athletes to compete in such events as one way of preparations. It has been a difficult year and we hope next year more races will come up so that our athletes can resume their normal lives,” said Tuwei.
