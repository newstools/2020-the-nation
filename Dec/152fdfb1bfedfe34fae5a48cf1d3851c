Suspected Al-Shabaab militants on Sunday attempted an attack on a Border Patrol Unit (BPU) vehicle in Lamu County, but were repulsed by police officers.
The officers in the vehicle, which was among escort cars in a convoy, reportedly escaped death narrowly in the incident along Lamu-Gamba road in Nyongoro.

"They did not hit our officers. No casualties have been reported," Coast region police boss Gabriel Musau told the Nation by phone.
Mr Musau said there were no casualties and that security agents pursued the attackers.
Police report
A police report said Corporal Abdi Ahmed of the BPU's Milhoi camp, who was in charge of the escort from Lamu to Gamba, reported the ambush at Gamba Police Station at about 12.45pm.
The report said the lead vehicle in the escort came under heavy attack at Lango La Simba at about 11.15am.

"The officers responded and a heavy exchange of fire ensued," said the report from Gamba Police Station.
"Vehicles behind the lead escort car were stopped as the officers battled the armed men," it said, adding the gunmen disappeared into nearby bushes after reinforcement arrived.
Police sources said a team from Tana Delta joined the operation.
Some 7.62mm special spent cartridges and others of an unknown kind were collected from the scene.
Past attacks
Suspected members of the terror group have carried out several attacks in the same area in the past, primarily targeting passenger vehicles and security agents.
In January, three people were killed and another three seriously wounded in an ambush on a bus heading from Mombasa to Lamu.
