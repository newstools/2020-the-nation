During this Covid-19 pandemic, it is of utmost importance to be thankful for the many acts of kindness. We are experiencing a difficult time occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic, yet it coincides with a monumental period in the Christian calendar: the birth of the son of God, Jesus Christ. We all wonder what lies in store for the next months, or probably years. As a people, are we going to rise up to the challenge of tomorrow?

Pandemic
We are all pilgrims in this pandemic journey, an experience shared across the globe. The questions of youngsters on the backseat of the car: ‘How much longer?’ ‘When will we get there?’… come to mind. Nobody knows, but hopefully the pandemic is helping us to break barriers and allowing us to support one another wherever there is need. We have to run with patience as we live in these strange times.
The wonders of technology have enabled us to see faces, hear voices, chat, worship, and attend meetings, but there is no touch, no presence, and no comforting awareness of somebody in your living room or beside you in the pew, no reassurance of a gentle hug or squeeze of the hand.
