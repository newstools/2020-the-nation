As a safeguard, stick to Airbnb terms and only send payments via its platform.Dubious characters lure clients to take this route, where they lose the digital protection and are likely to suffer. After a successful surgery in India, an elderly man was happy to return home on November 4, accompanied by his son. 

But on touching down at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, they learnt that a family member was down with Covid-19. This meant they could not proceed home in Lang’ata, Nairobi. 

A cousin, Michael Kibet, offered to help them find a house to stay for three nights. Mr Kibet logged into Airbnb, the online platform that links travellers and hosts, and reserved a house. So, they got into a taxi and headed for Garden Estate.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}




Mr Kibet had paid Sh9,000 for the three- day stay. 

However, following the pin location they had been given, their ended abruptly on the Thika highway. They looked around and saw a compound on their left, the only one that appeared close to the pictures on the site. Thinking that was the house, they drove in to a rude shock when the occupant, an unamused old man, demanded to know the reason for their arrival. 






“We explained to him what had happened, and he was perplexed. He said he had never listed his house on any site, let alone Airbnb,” Mr Kibet says. “The old man, however, noted that it was not the first occurrence, as another traveller once knocked at his door having been ‘booked’ there.” 

Upon calling the contact person, a man named Elijah, he apologised to them and said there had been a double booking, but disconnected the call when asked to refund the amount paid via M-Pesa. 

Double bookings 

“I suspect that the houses do not exist, and if they do, it could be that the people running the account do double bookings and have money sent through M-Pesa. He chooses the person to stay at the home,” says Mr Kibet. 

He wrote a complaint to Airbnb and he is yet to get a response, a month later, nor a refund.

});
}, 62000);
}




Mr Kibet’s is one of several reported cases where air is sold through Airbnb and other online reservation platforms like Booking.com. The popularity of this business model, which offers hospitality experience in between that of hotels and a rental houses at affordable rates, is attracting scammers who take advantage of existing loopholes to con unsuspecting customers. 

The con game happens in a number of ways, including listing of non-existent houses, using exquisite pictures to attract customers to pay more for sometimes dilapidated structures, and double bookings, where one party pays for an already occupied house. 

The catch here is that some clients are persuaded by the scammers to take the transactions offline after the sites link them up. 

While the sites work with rules, offering refunds to customers who change their minds not to occupy a property, sending money directly to the host takes away that insurance.

Reporting to the police is not an option many consider. Foi Wambui, a media personality and social media influencer, fell into such a trap in July, when she was looking for a place to spend her birthday weekend with family and friends. She went on Booking.com and came across Miotoni Mansion, which ticked all the boxes. 



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-3");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-3']]);
});
}, 62000);
}






if (shouldRenderAd(false)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("desktop-article-ad-2");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}




“It was a large, beautiful house with lots of rooms, a swimming pool and situated in Karen. I thought for a mansion it was also amazing that it fell within my price range. I just assumed it was because of the times we’re in,” says Wambui. 

It also happened to be available on the weekend she wanted. 

Pay full amount 

After booking, she got the host’s email address and a Kenyan number. She emailed the contact and also called the number but it wasn’t being answered. Some time passed before she received an email response and then an American number contacted her via WhatsApp. 

“She (the contact) went on to give me her email and Instagram handle. I checked them out and she had more than 10k followers on Instagram and some of the people I knew had even liked and commented on some posts. She then sent an invoice, asking me to pay the full amount two days before check-in. 

I told her what the rules said but she insisted that if the host hasn’t shared their bank details with the site, they can actually do this. It was strange, but everything looked good and professional,” recalls Wambui.

She paid half the amount via M-Pesa to the host’s “brother”, who was staying in the house. The host informed her they would give her an extra night if she gave a review of the house thereafter.

});
}




Her birthday was going to be lit! Her friend, an influencer too, was going to do a YouTube video about the place. The day before her birthday, she called to inquire about amenities available at the property. 

Her WhatsApp messages were getting two ticks but no responses. At one point, she could see the person was online and she tried calling but her calls were not picked. Her calls to the number she had made the M-Pesa payment to also went unanswered. She knew she had been conned. 

She moved to Instagram to see if any of her friends would know where to get the woman. One of her friends then told her that she was the second person to report having been scammed by the same woman. 

“He told me he had been following her, but she would DM him to ask for money so he stopped. He told me the other person scammed was Elodie Zone, who said it was on the exact house. They actually went there and found that no such house exists on Miotoni Road,” Wambui says.

Dubious dealings 

Booking.com couldn’t do anything because the communication and transaction happened outside the app. 

After investigations, they found out that the culprit was a man using a woman’s pictures on Instagram. Wambui decided not to pursue the matter further. The host, however, removed the property from the site and took down the Instagram account.

These kinds of dubious dealings are said to be rampant not only in Kenya, but across the world, where clients have been warned to ensure due diligence in their bookings to avoid falling prey to fraudsters who have been targeting the popular website, Airbnb, that advertises thousands of holiday rentals, now in 191 countries. 

The site has proved safe as long as users stick to its terms and conditions and only send payments via its platform. 

Back in 2017, the Guardian reported how a British family lost more than £4,100 (Sh617,885) to sophisticated Airbnb fraudsters after booking what they thought was a holiday villa in Sicily, Italy, for three weeks. 

Like it happens in scam listings, the conmen managed to persuade holidaymakers to send payments via bank transfers instead of the official account. The listing and apartment turned out to be fake. 

And like many other victims, the family was left contemplating whether suing the site would be a worthy cause. 

Another method used by cyber thieves is creating fake sites that mirror the original Airbnb in every way, except minor details that would take a keen eye - a technology eye -  to notice. 

The bank accounts in such fake sites would obviously belong to the thieves. By the time the guest realises it, they’re stranded at an unknown place with luggage at hand with money gone.
