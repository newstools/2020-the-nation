Late Machakos Senator Boniface Kabaka will be laid to rest on Tuesday next week, Chama Cha Uzalendo secretary-general Phillipe Sadjah has confirmed.
The burial will take place at Mikuyu in Masinga Sub-County in Machakos, he added. 
The legislator died last Friday just days after he collapsed at a hotel in Nairobi.

He was then rushed to Nairobi Hospital where he was placed under intensive care.
Initially, police had launched an investigation into suspected attempted murder. The accused was Ms Esther Nthenya Muli, who was with the lawmaker at the establishment when he collapsed.
Later, however, she was released from custody after the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ruled out any criminal charges. 
“Ms Muli was discharged from custody as there was no evidence linking her to the indisposition of Machakos Senator Boniface Mutinda Kabaka,” State prosecutor Joseph Irungu Gitonga said at the time.
