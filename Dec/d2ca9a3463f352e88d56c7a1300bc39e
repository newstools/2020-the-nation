But this means nothing to Joseph Epstein, an 83-year-old American writer and columnist for the Wall Street Journal who, until his latest sexist column denigrating Dr Biden for using the “Dr” title, was wallowing in the obscurity of a mildly successful career as an editor and adjunct lecturer.





Using denigrating language like “kiddo”, Epstein’s discomfort with Dr Biden’s success was clear: “Any chance you might drop the “Dr” before your name? Dr Jill Biden sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch of comic.” He also downplayed her dissertation, Student Retention at the Community College: Meeting Students' Needs, terming it “unpromising”. Mr Epstein, whose singular academic credential is a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Chicago — which he received in 1959 in absentia — quoted a saying from a “wise man” that “no one should call himself “Dr” unless he has delivered a child”.
Scepticism
What followed was a barrage of criticism towards Epstein but mostly public support for Dr Biden. Her experience is one too familiar to many accomplished women. 
We experience it often. Our ambitions are ridiculed, our credentials are met with scepticism and our accomplishments are minimised and capabilities are second guessed at every turn. We see it every day, this societal obsession with successful and self-assured women by openly disrespecting them.

We have seen it, women like Jill Biden — diligent, dedicated and ambitious — who have put in years of back breaking, soul crushing hard work only to have a sparsely accomplished man overlook, downplay and belittle their accomplishments simply because they are women.
In a classy response, Dr Jill Biden tweeted; “Together, we will build a world where the accomplishments of our daughters will be celebrated, rather than diminished.”
 However, I think it is time we began teaching our sons to be comfortable with highly accomplished women.
We need to let our boys know that a woman’s success does not translate to their personal failure and that it is perfectly okay to have a world in which both boys and girls succeed because there is enough success to go round.
