Those ‘lucky’ enough to pass the interviews can become heads of departments or even principals without portfolio.The teachers are like crabs in a bucket; one tries climbing up and reaches the edge just about to jump out, another climbs onto his back and they all fall back into the turmoil below If one needs to study the workplaces where there is a concentration of people with degrees, one need not look further. Just visit the nearest high school. Everyone you say ‘hallo’ to must be having several degrees and diplomas.
In such a situation, it is not easy to talk of meaningful career progression. The moment one gets employed and is posted to a school, he immediately realises the futility of even attempting to jump the ladder and grow. You find people that have stagnated in the same job group long before you were born.

The only formal way to move up the grade entails what the employer calls ‘interview’. These interviews are conducted irregularly once in a while and the teachers must apply to be considered.
Rape allegation
There were times they would travel to Nairobi for the same, but these days, the exercise is localised while the teachers are, ironically, delocalised. The questions during the interviews can come from anywhere and be about anything.

 A 50-year-old chemistry teacher, who has taught for some 30 years, may be asked to quickly name the Kapenguria Six, the President of Egypt or even how many stores ‘ought’ to be in a school. It is that simple, but the number of those that ‘pass’ the interviews are circumscribed by availability of funds.
These interviews are, of course, a sham and all those teachers qualify, but have to be trimmed down. Those ‘lucky’ enough to pass can become heads of departments or even principals without portfolio.
You just see them as classroom teachers, but they’re yearning to get to head some school. This is the source of a lot of danger and can even get as bad as blackmail, or sabotage.
Imagine a girl school where some 10 teachers in the staffroom qualify to be principal, but are still stuck to obeying the existing head. Add the fact that the incumbent is from another region and has been delocalised just when others are positioning themselves to take over the mantle.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-2");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {

});
}, 62000);

Qualified locals
Picture that the qualified locals are heading fast to their retirement and may even retire before the incumbent. The recipe is complete and something grand must happen to make way.
There are the times you will hear of an improbable rape case in a well-secured school, with students complaining about almost everything, and sexual harassment may be rumoured to be smothered by the principal.
This may seem far-fetched and ghastly, but they happen frequently and the public always supports the removal ‘lax’ headteachers.
Some resign while those that swear their innocence find themselves thrown as far away as possible. What goes to the bin is forgotten.
The teachers are like crabs in a bucket; one tries climbing up and reaches the edge just about to jump out, another climbs onto his back and they all fall back into the turmoil below.
It is in this context that we wish you to view the case of supposed rape in a big school in western Kenya. Find out what really happened after the investigations are completed.
