The KFCB has the unenviable task of defining what “clean content” entails for the nation and a film like Rafiki was simply collateral damage.Policing morality in films could end up being counterproductive by stifling creativity in the name of sanitising and regulating content What qualifies as clean content?
Here’s a hint: “It must not have a homosexual theme and clear intent to promote lesbianism in Kenya contrary to the law.”
This is the reason the Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) gave in 2018 for banning the film Rafiki. Before the ban, the Board had asked Wanuri Kahiu, the director, to change the ending, which was deemed “too hopeful and positive”. She refused. Good for her for refusing to bow to the demands of “clean content”.

The KFCB has the unenviable task of defining what “clean content” entails for the nation and a film like Rafiki was simply collateral damage. The Board has been on a long, arduous journey of ridding the airwaves of “dirty” content, going as far as appointing clean content ambassadors, announcing that through them, “the Board hopes to reach every corner of the nation and affect every sphere and field with our ‘Clean is Cool’ message.”





In the just-concluded Kisima Awards, KFCB awarded Sh1 million to Zamaradi Productions for the clean content in their film Dream Child. Dream Child is a flick about “a teenager called Kevin, who finds himself trapped between a cruel society and a seemingly kind but dark world”. KFCB announced that the film was awarded for its compliance with the requirements of the (Film and Stage Plays Act) Cap 222.
This sets a dangerous precedent. It would be interesting to read the judges’ remarks on how the marks for morality were awarded and what disqualified other films from scooping the award.
Monetary value
There’s something disturbing about attaching monetary value to morality, even if it’s meant as positive reinforcement. Shouldn’t morality be a bare minimum requirement for any film entered in the awards, especially since we know that X-rated movies will always stick to their lanes?

“Moral Cop” Dr Ezekiel Mutua’s efforts to prescribe what’s moral have always attracted praise and criticism in equal measure. It has also not escaped the nation’s attention that the rebukes have sometimes felt like religious sermons.
Policing morality in films could end up being counterproductive by stifling creativity in the name of sanitising and regulating content. Case in point, Rafiki.
In the wake of teenagers gone rogue in this Covid-19 period, and in the spirit of art being a reflection of society, an award for “cleanliness in content” could encourage the society to bury its head deeper in the sand on matters sex, drugs abuse and teenage pregnancies, which should be faced head-on.
The guidelines on sex, obscenity and pornography are quite clear in the programming code for free-to-air radio and television services in Kenya, so this is not a call to contravene this but to have open, artistic expression, minus the morality tag.
Monetary compensation for morality seems rather fraudulent, like an invitation — even pressure —for creatives to conform to a moral code that’s only evident to KFCB.
