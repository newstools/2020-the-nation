Kennedy Nyadimo, an Eldoret-based investor, has found a way to turn his love for dogs into a fairly successful business venture.
He breeds and trains dogs at his Maili Nne Estate home, then leases them out to area residents and businesses for protection at a fee.
When the Nation visited his home on Tuesday evening, Mr Nyadimo was busy preparing five of his dogs that had been hired for night assignments in different estates in Eldoret town.

“I decided to expand my dog breeding business in 2015 when I realised that Eldoret town was expanding rapidly hence the need for enhanced security that could be complimented by dogs,” said Mr Nyadimo.

He began with just one kennel and, five years down the line, he now boasts a pack of over 20 dogs. He says it costs a client Sh500 to hire a single dog for an overnight assignment.
“The minimum period of hiring a guard dog is one week. We agree with our clients on the best food that the dogs should be served during this period since they need to stay healthy all the time,” he explains.
He has also managed to create employment for others through this venture by hiring handlers to manage the dogs.
“Through this business, I have been able to purchase a parcel of land where I now stay and I have also been able to establish other businesses in the town,” he adds.
Biggest challenge
The businessman says that apart from hiring out the dogs for assignments, he also sells them to residents and other people interested in keeping the animals for security.

});

“We also sell these dogs and the prices vary depending on their variety and weight. Our main clients for this are security companies who want more guard dogs for their daily operations,” he explained.
He says that his neighbours are happy and proud of him since he has helped beef up security in the area.
“My neighbours are a happy lot because with my dogs around, their security is guaranteed. We also have some dogs that are able to sniff and locate lost animals. But I have to charge them a small fee whenever we handle such cases,” he added.

However, despite relative success, Mr Nyadimo notes that the biggest challenge with dog breeding is the expenses that come with treating and feeding the animals.
''These dogs have to be fed well. The food we give them is quite expensive but we have to do this since it is an investment worth it. When they fall sick, we have to bring in specialists to treat them. It is such a costly affair that requires a lot of sacrifice,” he explains.
His message to those interested in going into the same business is that they should first love dogs.
“If you have a passion for dogs, you will not see the burden of feeding them. Dogs need good care so that they can serve you better.”
