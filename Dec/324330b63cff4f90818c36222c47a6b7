During a field mission to the mangrove forests of northern Mozambique, I introduced myself to the host communities as coming from Kenya.  Then I asked, “What do you know about Kenya?”
Majority of my audience had no clue about Kenya. Some even thought I was from Tanzania, Zimbabwe or Malawi. This is understandable considering that these countries border Mozambique. Having come across M-Pesa kiosks in the villages of Mozambique, I proceeded to ask, “Who knows about M-Pesa?”

On this, all hands were up. I am sure there exists other mobile financial services in Mozambique, but when I saw how M-Pesa is impacting lives in rural Mozambique, I was proud to be a Kenyan.
My visit to Mozambique was organised through WWF-Country Office in Maputo.
WWF has an active marine programme in country and is currently implementing the Blue Forests project in Nampula and Zambezia provinces.





Climate change
Blue forests is a term used to denote coastal vegetated wetlands such as mangrove forests and seagrass beds. In addition to providing habitats for fish, blue forests capture and stores huge stocks of carbon in both above and below ground components. When degraded, they not only halt storing carbon but more importantly they release the stored carbon back to the atmosphere causing climate change. It is for these reasons that many countries are including blue forests in their national development and climate change agenda.
Due to language barriers, a local translator, Mr Lourenco Ernesto Papissone, aka Cassava, was assigned to me. Cassava and I traversed coastal villages in Angoche and Mona districts collecting data on mangrove forests, threats facing them, and opportunities for their restoration and management within Premerias and Secundas Environment Protected Area; abbreviated as PSEPA.

With an area exceeding 1.1 million hectares, PSEPA is one of the largest marine protected areas in Africa.
Established in 2012, PSEPA is endowed with diversity of habitats, such as mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and coral reefs that support high biodiversity and community livelihood.
However, the region is extremely vulnerable to changes occurring due to increased frequency and intensity of extreme events such as floods, droughts, sea level rise and cyclones.  For instance, in 2019, cyclones Idai and Kenneth caused massive damages to infrastructure thus impacting on community livelihood and wellbeing.
Direct cash payments
My mission to Mozambique was, therefore, to promote an incentive-based scheme that would allow communities to receive direct cash payments through sale of mangrove ecosystem services, in this case carbon credits.
Our pioneering Mikoko Pamoja in Kenya is already saving the endangered mangroves and generating millions of shillings for local communities. Every year, since 2013, communities in Gazi bay of Kwale County receive Sh1.5 million (USD15,000) from the sale of mangrove carbon credits. Income generated from sale of carbon credits is then used to support local development projects in water and sanitation, education, health, and environmental conservation.

So far, Mikoko Pamoja has provided educational materials to 900 school children, improved water access for 5,000 community members and ensured that the 615ha of mangroves in Gazi bay are restored and protected. 
In 2017, Mikoko Pamoja won the coveted United Nations Equator Prize.
Activities of Mikoko Pamoja have so far been replicated in Vanga bay, in Kenya, as well as in Madagascar. It is on this basis that we ventured to replicate a similar carbon offset facility for the benefit of climate, community and biodiversity in PSEPA.
Journey to Mozambique
Regulations required that a Covid-19 test be taken 72 hours prior to travelling to Mozambique. For this, I proceeded to Mombasa Hospital for the test on December 11, 2020 that turned out negative.  A similar test was repeated in Mozambique on December 22 to allow me travel back home. The two Covid-19 tests cost an equivalent of Sh18,000.
A Kenyan national visiting Mozambique for less than three months does not require a visa. I took advantage of this provision and headed to the airport immediately I received my Covid results. Five hours later, I am in Nampula via Lilongwe, Malawi, on Kenya Airways fight KQ 576. A return journey direct to Nairobi takes less than three hours.

It took almost an hour for the immigration department in Nampula to clear me for Covid-19 and the Yellow Fever. I was booked for an overnight stay at New Hotel Nampula, a splendid facility in the heart of the city. The following morning I was picked for the coastal city of Angoche.
Entry port
According to Wikipedia, Angoche is one of the earliest settlements in Mozambique founded in 1490s by refugees from Kilwa, Tanzania. The city was conquered by the Portuguese in 1860s and continued serving as an important entry port to the interior of the country. Today, Angoche is a quiet and somehow a dilapidated town with few reminders of its glorious past. Processing factories for cashews and coconuts have shut down, forcing communities to seek livelihood opportunities elsewhere, particularly from mangrove and fishery resources.





The distance from Nampula to Angoche is about 180km, but it takes a 3 to 4 hours’ drive due to poor conditions of the road.
Mozambique is a big country, with a coastline exceeding 2,700km; this is more than five times the Kenyan coastline. Infrastructure developments in the northern part of the country have remained low.  This is despite the fact that Ilha de Mozambique, an Island city in Nampula Province, was once the capital city of the country.

I enquired why the area has generally been marginalised as compared to other parts of the country.  The answer given was that northern Mozambique, including Nampula Province, have remained in opposition politics since independence.
Outside politics, Nampula is a beautiful area. Picturesque protruding bare rocks, expansive Miombo woodlands and large bays and reefs that support white beaches characterise the landscape.
Miombo woodlands are the remnants of extensive coastal forests of Eastern Africa which once stretched from Inhambane in southern Mozambique to Somali. Today, these habitats are fragmented across the coastal areas in the region. In Kenya, coastal forests are represented by the Kayas, Shimba hills, Arabuko-Sokoke and Ngoni forests.
Saving mangroves in PSEPA
Mangrove forests are a characteristic feature of coastal areas of Mozambique in bays, lagoons and estuarine of major rivers.  There are 71,000ha of mangroves in PSEPA representing about 25 per cent of mangroves in the country.  These forests serve as habitats for fish and other wildlife, protect the shoreline from erosion as well as providing harvestable wood and non-wood products to thousands of communities in the area.
PSEPA is within the dune coast of Mozambique and as such, it is characterised by shifting shorelines. Temperature in the area averages 25 degrees centigrade throughout the year. A combination of shifting dunes and scorching temperatures is one of the reasons of low mangrove forest structure in PSEPA. In most of the sites visited, tree height averaged 8 metres with standing biomass of less than 180tonnes/ha, which is much lower than biomass values in Kenya.

Like in most areas in eastern Africa, mangroves along the coast of Mozambique have been degraded, abused and removed.  In PSEPA, for instance, over-harvesting of wood products, conversion of mangrove areas to other land uses, pollution and climate change effects have severely impacted on the mangroves. Losses and degradation of mangroves has affected local and national economy as witnessed by shortages of firewood and building poles, reduction in fisheries and increased shoreline erosion.
Basic amenities lacking
During reconnaissance surveys that lasted for 10 days, we visited mangroves close to human habitations in Angoche and Moma districts. By any standards, a number of human settlements in PSEPA can be described as poor. The villages lack basic amenities such as schools, clean drinking water, and health facilities. Illiteracy levels are also high, with men in Moma and Angoche districts being ranked as the most illiterate in the Mozambique.
The United Nations categorises Mozambique as a least developed country (LDC).
In 2019, the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was estimated at USD455. Agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors are the economic drivers of Mozambique that contribute more than 30 per cent of the GDP.

}



Total capture fishery in Mozambique is about 329,000 per year with marine contributing some 70 per cent of this. Some 65,000 people are engaged in fishing activity, both men and women.
Fish consumption
Per capita consumption of fish in Mozambique is 11.6kg compared to the global average rate nearing 20kg. Per capita fish consumption in Kenya is only 4.5kg. 
To sustain the high fish appetite in Mozambique (as everywhere in the world), deliberate efforts must be made to safeguard critical fish habitats that include mangrove swamps.
Overall support from the government for mangrove management in Mozambique is high. The national mangrove management strategy (2017-2027) aims to improve productivity and resilience of mangrove forests for biodiversity conservation and community benefits. It also intends to minimise the effects of global warming through mangrove capture and storage, thus contributing to global development goals and the Paris Agreement. The government has further committed itself to the restoration of 5000ha of degraded mangroves areas. These activities would generate eligible carbon credits that could be traded in the voluntary carbon markets.

Potential carbon revenue from PSEPA mangroves



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-8");
});
}



Over the 1998-2018 period, mangroves of PSEPA decreased by 11,200 hectares, translating to an annual loss of 563ha. Such loss activates carbon dioxide emissions from mangrove forests and the sediment. Potential carbon loss from mangroves in PSEPA is estimated at 100 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare, giving total emissions of 56,300 tons of carbon dioxide per year. Payments for ecosystem services schemes such as the UN’s reduced emissions from avoided deforestation and forest degradation (or REDD+) is a potential avenue for rewarding those involved in mangrove conservation activities. Assuming an offset price of USD10 per ton of carbon dioxide, the estimated carbon revenue of mangroves in PSEPA is USD 563,000 per year, plus other co-benefits such as fishery functions and shoreline protection. This justifies our pursuit for a carbon offset project in PSEPA.
The next phase of the project should be defining boundaries where carbon projects can be established within PSEPA. This will be followed by detailed remotes sensing and field surveys to ascertain degradation hotspots and carbon baselines.
Equally important is the commitments from communities targeted for carbon offset projects in PSEPA.  This is achievable through community consultation and capacitation on monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of mangrove forest carbon.

Mozambique is already at an advanced stage of the MRV process in terrestrial forests that is coordinated through the Ministry of Land, Environment and Rural Development. Further, Mozambique has signed the first Emission Reduction Payment Agreements (ERPA) with World Bank, unlocking USD50 million to support the country’s ongoing efforts to reduce carbon emissions from its forest sector.
Being carbon rich ecosystems, mangroves could serve as long hanging fruits for accelerating low carbon pathways in Mozambique at the same time providing livelihood support in the post-Covid recovery period.
