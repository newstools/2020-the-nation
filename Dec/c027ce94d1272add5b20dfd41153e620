This is not the first time MCSK is in the limelight for the wrong reasons.Last year, the organisation came under attack from Kenyan artistes and their fans over royalties. Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK), umbrella body which pays musicians their royalties, has suffered a blow after its license was revoked by the Kenya Copyright Board (KCB).
The Board revoked the operating licence of MCSK after it failed to adhere to existing licensing conditions, including failing to submit a complete authenticated list of members.

});

The organisation had also not uploaded its members' musical works into the digitised National Rights Registry (NRR) database as required by the law.
“The funds belonging to the Society will be held secure until the shortfall is resolved to the satisfaction of KECOBO,” said board chair Mutuma Mathiu, adding that MCSK’s management has already been made aware of the decision.
This is not the first time MCSK is in the limelight for the wrong reasons. Last year, the organisation came under attack from Kenyan artistes and their fans after it was discovered that it offered Sh2,500 each to musicians as royalties.

Some of the popular musicians who accused MCSK of exploiting them are Khaligraph Jones and King Kaka. They castigated MCSK, terming the organisation as unprofessional for failing to honour its obligations to musicians.
However, the official confirmed that the licences of other MCSK partners, the Kenya Association of Music Producers (KAMP) and Performers Rights Society of Kenya (PRISK), were not canceled and remain valid.
Transparency purpose
The Board also expressed satisfaction with the progress made on the National Rights Registry and the Collective Management Organisations (CMO) ICT system noting it was substantially complete and already serving its intended registration of copyright and transparency purpose.

“Though there is little more work that remains to perfect the system, over 7,500 new works and over Sh20 million have been collected over the system by (CMO) since June 2020,” Mr Mathiu disclosed.
The Board also approved a policy that will guide the operations of the CMOs to ensure good corporate practices among them transparency, cost saving and fitness for purpose in service of its members. 
“The approved policy will be uploaded on the KECOBO website for final public comments before implementation as from 16th December to 15th January 2021,” added Mr Mathiu.
KECOBO Executive Director, Mr Edward Sigei, said the CMOs Royalty Collection system offers those that exploit music in the course of business an opportunity to obtain a consolidated music licence from the comfort of their homes. 
“All copyright rights holders and businesses that use music are encouraged to utilise the system robustly by voluntary uploading their work and paying for their licenses in a seamless manner,” said Sigei.
