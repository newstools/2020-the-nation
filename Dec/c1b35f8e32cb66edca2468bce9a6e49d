Women have come of age in civil enlightenment and commitment to good causes.They shouldn’t just wait for favourable laws to be enacted without their being invited to the high table. The recent election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as President and Vice-President, respectively, of the United States has many lessons for Kenya as we head towards 2022.
It shatters many gender myths that have consigned our women to cheer leadership and away from the decision-making table.
This result shows that women have the clout to make any political party win such a monumental election, and as such, the 78 million votes cast for Biden-Harris comprised a big chunk of women voters.

This is a wake-up call to Kenyan and African women in general to rise to the occasion and change the voting patterns. 
Women have come of age in civil enlightenment and commitment to good causes. They shouldn’t just wait for favourable laws to be enacted without their being invited to the high table. They can take action at the ballot and, hence, come up with their folded seats at the table.

Flower girls
The lessons are galore to the male leaders to trust in the capacities of women to offer their skills and not see them as political flower girls. 
It is an established fact that women leaders have more emotional intelligence and empathy than men — two traits necessary to lead in the 21st Century.
But women leaders should abandon petty and juvenile fights and focus on service delivery and development so as to be different from which they seek to replace. 
US officials have announced and certified the actual results even where the pressure was on them to do otherwise.
Save for a few hitches, those in charge of the transition have dutifully done their part. The lesson here is the need for a strong and effective public service. 
We should also make some positions, like principal secretary, more permanent, giving us the necessary stability to industrialise and achieve Vision 2030 and other related national goals.
