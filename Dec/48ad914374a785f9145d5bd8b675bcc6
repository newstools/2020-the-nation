The Mandera county government has commissioned a Sh200 million fire station, which will help in mitigating disasters under its rapid response plan.
The plan has seen Mandera acquire two modern fire engines and other assorted equipment, besides building a command centre.
Mandera Governor Ali Roba described the development as iconic and part of his legacy as he leaves office in 2022 after serving for two terms.

“This iconic fire station we are launching today is important to the people of Mandera because it is the first fire station in northern Kenya since independence and will go a long way in supporting public safety against fire disasters and rapid response protection for valuable property,” he said on Wednesday.
He said that with the fire station, Mandera is celebrating a milestone in the journey of resilience and transformation.

Residents of Mandera town welcomed the project, and urged the county government to extend the same service to other towns.
“Previously residents would watch helplessly as their property went up in flames. We are proud today that we have an effective response team whose results we have seen in recent days,” said Ms Alphone Dahir.

Managed fire outbreaks
The new fire brigade has managed to effectively contain several outbreaks in Mandera town, including a fire incident at Moi Girls' Secondary School.
Governor Roba applauded the fire brigade, promising to have more funds allocated for better equipment.
“Let us congratulate the team for a job well done. At Kamor Primary School, they contained a field fire and at Koromey farms, they have contained several wild bush fires,” he said.

});

Records in Mandera Municipality indicate the county recorded 13 fire incidents in 2018, another 29 cases in 2019 and 155 cases in 2020.
The team consists of 28 trained firefighters.
To keep the fire brigade prepared, Governor Roba’s administration organises regular drills to keep the fire crew fit for assignments.
The Mandera Municipality fire station sits on a two-acre piece of land and is equipped with an underground water tank with a capacity of 100,000 litres.
Mr Roba said Mandera town has critical installations, including an airport, and a fast growing urban area all of which require emergency fire rescue teams to be always ready.
“We remain committed to building their capacity and investing in the expansion of this service throughout the county,” he said.
Train youth
He promised to ensure that the youth are sponsored to train in emergency rescue operations.
The governor ordered the county’s Ministry of Roads and Public Works to ensure that all building plans come with fire detection equipment as a preventive measure for fire disasters.
“I hereby direct the Ministry of Public Works to ensure all county government buildings are fitted with fire detection equipment going forward,” he said.

});
}, 62000);
}



Poor town planning, leading to blocking of access roads, was cited as the major setback in emergency response.

});
}, 62000);
}



The governor asked the concerned county department to ensure access roads are opened up as he called on residents of Mandera town to understand the exercise will be about their safety.
“We have a budget to open up our roads within estates and that will be happening soon. Kindly bear with us if your plot is affected because all this is about your safety,” said Mr Roba.
