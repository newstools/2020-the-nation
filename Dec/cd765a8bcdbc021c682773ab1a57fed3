It occurred to me that whereas distance running legend Eliud Kipchoge will have to contend with running over 42 kilometres for at least two hours in search of gold medal at the Olympics, others will actually dance their way to Olympic gold medalsOn Monday, IOC announced the addition of four new sports – breakdancing, skateboarding, sport climbing and surfing - to the 2024 OlympicsWorld Athletics President Sebastian Coe cried foul after cross country failed to make it into the programme for 2024 Olympic Games Last Monday, sleep deserted me when the International Olympics Committee (IOC), the body that organises the Olympic Games, announced that breakdancing would be one of the sporting events at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.
I had been holed up in isolation much of the previous week and, in that solitary isolation, I thought I had used the time to think about just everything  I needed to so as to clear my mind in between staring at the ceiling board.

Then it occurred to me that whereas distance running legend Eliud Kipchoge will have to contend with running over 42 kilometres for at least two hours in search of gold medal at the Olympics, others will actually dance their way to Olympic gold medals!
On Monday, IOC announced the addition of four new sports – breakdancing, skateboarding, sport climbing and surfing - to the 2024 Olympics. Whereas skateboarding, sport climbing and surfing will debut at the 2020 Olympics which will take place in Tokyo from July 23 next year, breakdancing will make its entry to the Olympics in 2024.

});
}, 62000);
}



The IOC said the changes were aimed at making the Olympic Games appeal to a younger audience. The acrobatic dance battles will be known as “breaking” at the Olympics.
Immediately the announcement was made, Australian squash legend Michelle Martin said the Olympics have become a mockery.
“It’s sort of making a mockery of what the Olympics is. When you look at what it all used to stand for, the Olympics, it definitely fits in the category.  What does the Olympics stand for these days, I don’t really know. They either need to go back to what the Olympics was about and let the other sports stay outside of that because the problem is it’s having such an impact on the sports that don’t get into the Olympics now. The Olympics has lost what it was. Yes, they’re trying to move with the times but it’s creating a mockery of the thing,” Martin told British media.

Because squash has unsuccessfully lobbied for decades to be included at the Olympics, it is very easy to think Martin is just being bitter. But none other than World Athletics President Sebastian Coe cried foul after cross country failed to make it into the programme for 2024 Olympic Games.
In Coe’s view, cross country is an exciting and fast growing sport around the world which deserved a place at the Olympics, given its heritage in France at the 1924 Paris Olympics.
I was also taken aback by the admission of breakdancing to the Olympics. It does not help things that it has come at the expense of cross country, a competition in which Kenya has a good track. The legendary Paul Tergat and John Ngugi each won a record five world cross country titles, and Hellen Obiri currently holds the women’s world title.
The changes are part of Olympic Agenda 2020, a set of 40 recommendations adopted by the IOC session in 2014. According to IOC, the changes are aimed at safeguarding the Olympic values and strengthening the role of sport in society. They were driven by a recognition that the world was evolving rapidly and that the Olympic Movement had the opportunity to be an agent of change.





My take is that the changes are well-intended, but the classification and implementation is wanting. Rather than make breakdancing an Olympic sport, it can allow breakdancing championships to run parallel to the Olympic Games as it did with wushu tournament in 2008 in Beijing.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-3']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



In 2008, IOC permitted a wushu (Chinese martial art which is a complete contact sport) tournament to run parallel to the 2008 Beijing Olympics rather than being trialed as part of the Olympics.
Creating a category separate from the Olympics to reward excellence in breakdancing will solve the matter.
