 Police in Rongo Sub-County are tracing a woman who dumped her two-month-old baby at the doorstep of Rongo G4S offices.
Rongo Sub-County Police Commander, Mr Peter Okiring, said the infant was spotted by local traders on Tuesday night.
“Women who were from the market heard the baby crying in the cold and alerted authorities who went for her. We are tracing the whereabouts of the mother,” Mr Okiring said.

He called on residents to report a case of any parent who may be missing a child.
"The baby is under the custody of the government and we have launched investigations into why she was dumped at the specific place," Okiring said.
He said they have already collected statements from several people and they will soon narrow down on the suspect.
Witnesses told the Nation that the baby was wrapped in warm clothes and left sleeping on the floor.





Mrs Margret Akinyi, a trader, said the baby might have woken up hungry, prompting the incessant wails that alerted passersby.
Traders named the child Esther Nichiole before she was taken to Kamagambo Police Station and later transferred Rongo Children Department.
