Vihiga Queens coach Alex Alumirah said players were nervous about tests but the medics handling the process were very professional which helped the players relax.
"Most of the players were not comfortable with the intrusive process that saw the medics swab their nostrils and throats but it all went well and now we are back to training hoping that all the results will come back negative and we defend our title successfully," said Alumirah whose side welcome Wadadia at Mumias Complex on Sunday.
Zone A's Makolanders also endured a similar situation at their training base, BuruBuru Sports Complex in Nairobi.
"This is the first time for most of us and the process is not fun at all. In fact, it's very uncomfortable but we warmed up to it because we are doing it for the greater good of the team," said midfielder Lucy Njeri.
Makolanders , who finished at position 10 last season, will be up against Kibera Girls Soccer Academy in their league opener at Camp Toyoyo Grounds.
