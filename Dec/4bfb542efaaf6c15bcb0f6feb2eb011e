Algiers,
President Abdelmadjid Tebboune returned to Algeria Tuesday after a two-month absence in Germany, where he received treatment for Covid-19, ending a period of uncertainty in a country facing a health, political and economic crises.
"It is hard to be far from one's country and even harder for someone who has a lot of responsibility," Tebboune said, according to footage broadcast after he arrived from Berlin.

Seemingly in good health, Tebboune, who looked to have regained weight since his last television appearance over two weeks ago, was greeted by several senior Algerian officials, including Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad and army chief of staff Said Chengriha.
The President spoke briefly, wishing "a happy new year to all Algerians", "much better than 2020", and implying that he was almost cured of the virus.

PM happy
The Prime Minister said he was "happy to see the President of the republic back in his homeland to convalesce" and "eager to continue the work to achieve the objectives of the 'new Algeria'."
Tebboune made his last televised appearance on December 13, looking visibly thinner after weeks in treatment, saying he was "on the road to recovery".
Aged 75 and a heavy smoker, he was hospitalised in Germany on October 28, and Algerian authorities later announced he had the Covid-19 illness.
He had finished his treatment and left hospital at the end of November, but extended his stay in Germany for a period of convalescence.
His prolonged absence had sparked concerns of an institutional crisis, after voters in November approved a revised constitution on record low turnout in a referendum widely seen as a manoeuvre to neutralise a long-running protest movement.

} The country's Health ministry says at least 9,146 health workers have been infected by the virus. President Abdelmadjid Tebboune says he is recovering from the Covid-19 illness. The journalists were covering an earlier incident where Bobi Wine and his bodyguard were arrested by police. Before his disappearance and death, Kipyegon Kenei was to record a statement at the DCI headquarters. Education CS says the government has done everything possible to facilitate the resumption of learning in schools.
