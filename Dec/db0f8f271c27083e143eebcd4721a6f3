Marcus Rashford's 93rd minute strike beat Wolves 1-0 to move Manchester United into second in the Premier League as fears over the continuation of the season due to rising coronavirus infection rates grew on Tuesday.
A record 18 positive tests for Covid-19 among players and staff were detected in the weekly round of testing.

After Manchester City's trip to Everton on Monday was postponed due to a Covid outbreak in Pep Guardiola's squad, all five matches scheduled for Tuesday went ahead despite disruption for Sheffield United and Southampton.
Bottom-of-the-table United revealed they had suffered a number of positive cases but were still able to field a squad of 18 for their 1-0 defeat at Burnley.
Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl coached his side from his home for a 0-0 draw against West Ham after a member of his household tested positive.





The Telegraph reported the Premier League will discuss plans for a two-week circuit breaker with infection rates soaring across England.
However, Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer called for the competition to continue.
"I'm not sure if stopping playing football will make a difference," said Solskjaer, whose side are mounting an unexpected title challenge after a slow start to the season.
"In our bubble we've proven to be quite (safe), we haven't had too many cases transmitting within the group."

But United answered Solskjaer's call to win more games late on in the style he did as a player during Alex Ferguson's time at Old Trafford as Rashford's shot took a wicked deflection off Romain Saiss deep into stoppage time.
"This is a big step forward that you don't perform, but you still win," added Solskjaer. The win comes after the 3-1 victory over Chelsea on Boxing Day and lifts the Gunners to 13th place with 20 points. Manchester City's clash at Everton was postponed on Monday. The DP's ambition to take over from his boss after the 2022 elections is a road with two paths. The decision is a blow to two aspirants who had applied to the party for sponsorship to contest the seat. This shift of focus is so dire that the World Health Organization now warns that by the end of 2020, more people will have died of malaria than Covid-19.
