I am writing in response to Dr George Manyali’s treatise published in DN, December 24, 2020 titled, ‘PhD by publication enhances the quality of scientific work’. In the article, he rightly reports that for a long time, universities have awarded PhDs to students on the basis of publication in peer-reviewed journals.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-1");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



Up to that point, it is completely agreeable because the move by the Commission for University Education (CUE) to reintroduce PhD through both coursework and thesis is not only wasteful, but also redundant and lackadaisical.
This is because the coursework that the PhD students are taught is merely a repetition of what they did at both undergraduate and master’s levels; the only difference is adding the word ‘Advanced’ to the course title. In fact, the best universities in the world award PhDs by publication only; some of our professors got their PhDs through this module.





Bottom-up approach
However, the point of departure with Dr Manyali’s argument is when he proposes the use of Kiswahili in PhD writing. Such a move will throw a spanner into the works and bring a lot of confusion.
First, most disciplines (except Kiswahili itself) are taught in English right from basic education. Introducing Kiswahili as a way of ‘marketing’ it amounts to solving a problem by running away from it.
Secondly, Kenya is a Commonwealth member and is bound by the tradition that the states adhere to, especially with regards to the system of education.
 Therefore, introducing this requirement will violate this tradition and will pose a risk to the graduates in terms of being accepted in member countries. Lastly, it is not true that introducing Kiswahili at PhD level will accelerate the growth of the language; very few people manage to reach this level.

});
}, 62000);
}



If enhancing Kiswahili is one of the proposals that Dr Manyali is fronting, he can change tack and adopt a bottom-up approach, where Kiswahili is taught in all disciplines right from basic education as one goes up the academic ladder and not the top-bottom approach that he is proposing.
