The government has cleared medical bills for Dr Stephen Mogusu, who died of Covid-19 complications, making it possible for his family to collect his body and plan for the burial, tentatively set for Friday.
A letter from the Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral and Research Hospital, where Dr Mogusu died of virus-related complications, confirmed the bills had been paid.

});
}, 62000);
}



The letter also said the bill was Sh204,618, contrary to reports that it was about Sh1 million.
“A clearance letter was issued to the wife in order to process the burial permit. The hospital is waiting for the family to collect the body,” a statement from the hospital’s Credit Control Office says.
KMPDU’s demand
The government cleared the bills two days after medics made the demand and said Dr Mogusu’s young family should be compensated.

});
}, 62000);
}



“KMPDU demands the Ministry of Health takes full responsibility for all outstanding medical bills and compensation to the family,” said acting Secretary-General Chibanzi Mwachonda.
The 28-year-old intern doctor, who died on Monday, had reportedly not received his monthly salary for five months and lacked insurance.
His death caused a hue and cry among the public, most of whom accused the government of not offering the best working environment for health workers.
Dr Mogusu was the 13th doctor to die of Covid-19 complications, his colleagues saying it is due to the government’s failure to provide them with protective gear.
KMPDU is planning a strike from December 21 should the government fail to meet doctors’ demands.
So far, the coronavirus disease has killed 1,568 people in Kenya.

Sisters caution politicians against using their brother’s death to push their selfish interests. He served in former president Daniel Moi's cabinet. BBI secretariat cleaned up the 5.2 million signatures that endorsed the Bill, and weeded out 800,000 that had entry irregularities. This comes days after he collapsed at a hotel in Nairobi and was placed under intensive care at Nairobi Hospital.
