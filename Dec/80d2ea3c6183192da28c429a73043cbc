 Unfortunately for our universities, Performance Contracting  has not only shifted from their main mandates, but also turned into a mere routine check.Teachers collaborate to score themselves highly, and placate their employer’s ego through timely online submission of reports.   It is not in doubt that any organisation worth its salt must subject itself to Quality Management System (QMS). This facilitates certification, whereupon the concerned parties seek feedback through relevant audits, paving way for improvement.
There are many avenues of QMS, most based on International Organization for Standardisation (ISO) 9001. Here, organisations commit themselves to particular world class specifications for products, services and systems, often expressed in terms of performance indicators.

 Unfortunately for our universities, Performance Contracting (PC) has not only shifted from their main mandates, but also turned into a mere routine check.
For instance, you will find staff at universities struggling to fill endless reports in the name of compliance. Almost all government agencies are flocking these institutions, demanding that the latter account for what they have done towards achieving certain targets.





Corruption
The institutions have been turned into secretariats for PC reporting — on corruption, national cohesion, public complaints, drugs and substance abuse, disability mainstreaming, road safety, and what not.
Whereas these constructs make sense, the details required are far much removed from the core functions of the institutions.
It isn’t clear how the ritualistic reporting enhances the mandates of universities. Methinks the education sector adopted PC thoughtlessly. Whereas most universities are ISO certified, for example, their underperformance in key areas such as financial management and academics betray these bureaucratic ideals.
Online submission
QMS has worked well for production industry; but it may come a cropper if it is not well domesticated in education.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-2");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



A classic example is the current Teacher Performance and Appraisal Tool, which, on scrutiny, appears a vain exercise. Teachers collaborate to score themselves highly, and placate their employer’s ego through timely online submission of reports. 
It is high time that the institutions were allowed to narrow down to certain key performance indicators, so as to make it easy for them to stay focused.
As things stand, university leadership remains beholden to irrelevant performance indicators that earn them certification, yet the institutional output cannot be felt. Consequently, the whole certification process becomes a farce.
True certification needs to be reflected in the overall achievement of the core mandates of universities, with emphasis on their ability to proffer solutions to societal problems.
