Sh1.5 million 

“Examination of the documents submitted by the consultant for payment implies the consultant was hired way before the procurement process started. For instance, the first payment amounting to Sh1.5 million was made on 8th March 2018, the same date the request for proposal was issued. The payment was supported by an invoice dated 5th March 2018, which was long before the contract was signed,” Ms Gathungu wrote.

Launched investigations 

 The management had defended the move to be based on the fact that the supplier was also the manufacturer of the equipment without providing any evidence to back the claim. 

Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission launched an investigation into the supply which has seen some former staff of KPC taken to court. 

“Whereas the spare parts delivered by the vendor were subject to EACC investigation, the company put them to use only after EACC authorised their use. However, the value of the items is yet to be recorded in the company books and are not included in the assets reflected in the financial statements,” Ms Gathungu wrote.
