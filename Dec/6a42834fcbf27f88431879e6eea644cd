Homecare is work, whose time and investment is weighing down the Turkana woman, and that must sink for an equal society to be birthed.To an indigenous Turkana woman, life is a hand-to-mouth affair. The Covid-19 pandemic has depressed incomes and upended lives globally. Governments have activated various responses to pull through the pandemic, especially for businesses.
But the response design must be rethought to favour the informal women traders.
Generally, women have disproportionately borne the brunt of the losses across the business spectrum. And there’s seems a sense of neglect, overtly or covertly by authorities. The debate around the disproportionate effects of Covid-19 on women seems a wrapped episode.

For a long time, women have been branded home caregivers, a tag they have briskly shouldered through the daunting family demands for ages.
Homecare is historical, almost a rite diligently passed through generation to generation, and it is truly burdensome to women in the context of gender roles.

});

But what is more appalling is the denied reward for the homecare and the knock-on effect on the women’s socioeconomic being; and let us not rope in religion and the oppressive cultural regime as justification.
Work done is worth every penny, and should be compensated.
Beast of burden
Unpaid care and inequality undoubtedly cut across all trades in Kenya, but some counties are served a much shorter end of the stick.
 In Turkana County, which hosts some of the deepest forms of marginalisation and inequality in the country, is a hotbed of socioeconomic injustice among Kenya’s women folk.
Turkana women are a cultural beast of the burden. They have to fend for their families through menial work such as charcoal burning, basket weaving and basic ornament crafts.
This is in addition to taking care of animals, sick members of the family and the old folk. This situation hasn’t rung some alarm bells to the chieftains who continue to perpetuate the gender slavery doused in the cultural dogma of gender roles.

I dare say, it is high time the calculus shifted and a new conversation on pay for work reborn. Homecare is work, whose time and investment is weighing down the Turkana woman, and that must sink for an equal society to be birthed.
But there are other trade burdens. Firstly, a Turkana woman trader, as indeed most women traders in Kenya, runs a small scale business across the vast rural county.
According to rudimentary statistics from the Turkana County’s Ministry of Trade, Gender and Youth Affairs, out of the 10,000 businesses recently audited in all the six sub-counties, just slightly over 1,000 are registered, a truly paltry statistic.
Marsabit County is yet to generate a meaningful data of registered businesses.
I know the precondition by the government for a business to qualify for a Covid-19 stimulus package is registration, as a formal step to recognition.
I’m aware that the instruments for cash transfers are formal, and as such, the business structures must be formal. Which is my biggest problem. We must assess the protocols for business formalisation. But the process is a costly venture. No, “cost” in the small informal business context means every extra sum of money, whatever sum, and that is what must be factored in the governments’ push for business formalisation.

Marginalised businesses
To an indigenous Turkana woman, life is a hand-to-mouth affair. An extra cost is an extra burden, and a special consideration must suffice if the government is truly serious about fair and effective business safety-net to the low business cadres especially within the margins.
In a county like Turkana with over 80 percent illiteracy level (KNBS National census report 2019), a more moderated approach in business registration would be ideal. Business registration requires pin and certificate, tax instruments that the near entire rural women folk in Turkana barely fathoms.
Past practices seem to have only benefited small and medium enterprises, completely alienating the real hard hit population of the marginalised businesses.
Secondly, for the better part of the year, cross-border trade, which is the bastion of economy in the northern counties, was in shambles, thanks to the Covid-19 restrictions.
Borders were only open to essential goods and services, which came with its consequences. It may sound like I’m pitching for an illegality, but pragmatism is key here. Most cross-border businesses have been branded “smuggling” Because they have no formal identity.
But this a little off because illegality in the context of trade in the margins is not synonymous to theft, or robbery.

The only “crime” is the business they ply, which is considered faceless with no registration. But haven’t they been trading centuries before the western formalisation consumed us?
Formalisation is a noble idea, but the governments, both county and national must incubate a working formulae to support these special groups of traders in their informal business ventures.
Indigenous traders
The sooner the governments took note of the massive disenfranchisement in the period of the borders closures by the Turkana indigenous traders, the better and realistic the response would be.
Finally, there is need to assess the gender dynamics in the distribution of funds. The problem with our systems is the toxic male domination. Give it any name, call it meritocracy, reflection of the society, natural selection and so on; but women are way past the pass mark. Women have the ability and quality to lead.





 They meet all the criteria; have the acumen and wherewithal to deliver. We must reorganise the systems that purport to address women’s needs. Women’s needs are better addressed by the women. Let governments have women at the centre of women’s emergency responses if they are serious about walking the talk.

The composition we currently have in both county and national governments, are a mere decoration, flowers, in the name of women representation.
I’m aware the county and national governments are currently mulling Covid-19 business cash distribution. It is important to consider realistic cash transfer models to be used in disbursing the funds.
There could be significant mobile telephony penetration in the county, but not to that monumental level. And even if that were the case, mobile money registration has been a challenge. Deep down the pastoral villages, marginalisation has been at a grand scale that a national identification card has been an alien term.
And so as the population struggles to integrate into the national registration “grid”, a more inclusive and hybrid approach entailing physical money distribution through the provincial administration and the government’s digital platform can effectively deliver the deal. After all, we are because they are, Ubuntu spirit must prevail.  He served in former president Daniel Moi's cabinet.
