Now that his mandate is no longer under threat and sponsors are (seemingly) falling over themselves offering to sponsor local football, the ball is firmly in his court.One hopes that this New Year will bring better tidings, especially for women footballers who continue to be marginalised in every way possible. In a world rife with despondence and unexpected disruptions, most people were united by one emotion on Thursday at the stroke of midnight – relief that 2020 is finally over.
There’s no use belabouring the reasons for this collective feeling of relief. 2020 was the year when an invisible virus leapt from animals and invaded humanity, killing 1.8 million individuals and bringing top corporations, governments and economies to their knees. Sports was one of the first and most affected victims.

Back home, like two overlapping movies, the noise and mayhem at Kandanda House reached deafening levels, leading to an ongoing boycott of certain local sporting activities by a section of main stream media houses.
Mwendwa, who is in his second term as Football Kenya Federation president, has grown his list of enemies so much that it now includes chairmen of some top flight leagues, who should in fact be his key allies now that the management of the league is now a function of the federation. Needless to say, local mainstream media is firmly on the outside.





Besides that, there are many issues unsettled, including the salaries and allowances owed to national team players dating back to the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations in 2016.
Moreover, nothing has been heard of the recently elected women’s representative at the National Executive Council. Not even an outline of her plan or vision for women’s football, or if there are any structures to be put in place to grow women’s football in the country.
Granted, the women’s top flight league has kicked off, but the fear of frequent walkovers and mistreatment of players and technical bench members is yet to be addressed.
Trickier for the FKF leadership is how to assure the public that the grants from Fifa that are dedicated to women’s football are being put to good use, especially the Sh60 million meant for the Fifa Women’s Football Division pilot programme.

After a coaching workshop and referees training seminar for former and current women footballers in 2018, as well as a leadership and governance worship for elected women representatives in January last year, nothing has been heard of the project.
The promise to establish U-13 and U-15 girls’ leagues in primary schools remains fresh in the minds of women’s football advocates, as well as the organisation of a girls’ youth festival as promised last year during a status visit by Fifa Chief of Women’s Football, Sarai Bareman in August last year.
The problem for the local FA president is that going into 2021, there is little to suggest that external parties are to blame for the bedlam at Kandanda House.
Now that his mandate is no longer under threat and sponsors are (seemingly) falling over themselves offering to sponsor local football, the ball is firmly in his court.
One hopes that this New Year will bring better tidings, especially for women footballers who continue to be marginalised in every way possible. The new year has a rude welcome in the end of the Covid-19 tax reliefs. Without fees during the nine-month closure, many private schools were unable to pay staff, teachers and other workers. Senator speaks about a meeting that saved Nairobi, his governorship candidature and more.
