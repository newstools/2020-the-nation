The Labour court has ordered the striking Tharaka Nithi healthcare workers to immediately call off their industrial action until a case filed by the county government is heard and determined.
In a court order seen by the Nation, Justice Njagi Marete, sitting in Meru on December 8, 2020, ordered the health workers who downed their tools on Monday to resume work immediately and continue offering services as they await the determination of the matter.

The matter will be mentioned on December 10, 2020 for further directions.
The striking healthcare workers are demanding compressive medical cover, compensation for those who succumb to Covid-19, and formation of a health service commission to ensure that those working under both national and county governments are treated equally.
The medics also want an increment of a monthly risk allowance from the current Sh3,000 per person to Sh30,000, among other demands.

Addressing journalists at Chuka County Referral Hospital Wednesday, Governor Muthomi Njuki said his administration has met most of the demands by the health workers and that the rest will only be handled by the national government.
He noted that he had cleared salary arrears of Sh233 million that had accumulated since 2016, promoted those who deserved and employed on permanent and pensionable terms those who had been hired on contract by the previous regime.
The county boss noted that he has no capacity to increase the risk and that he has no power to ensure the formation of a health service commission.
Mr Njuki warned that those who will not resume duty will lose their monthly salary and in case they stay away for the whole month they will be sacked.

“Tharaka Nithi people cannot suffer because our healthcare workers want to be in solidarity with the rest in the country while I have met all their needs,” said Governor Njuki.
A spot check by the Nation established that the hospitals were still abandoned by Wednesday 11 am.
