National days like Jamhuri should be occasions for soul-searching and stock-taking.  Folks who were born in December 1963 are now grandparents. Most of them are looking forward to retirement from their jobs — if they still have any during these troubled times.
They are as old as Independent Kenya itself and they have, without fail, been celebrating Jamhuri Day since 1964. In short, this country has come of age, but it is fast sliding towards premature senescence.

A cursory look at the problems buffeting us and the lopsided priorities of our leadership tells us that though we may be maturing as a nation, we are still, like babes, mindlessly tottering towards an abyss.
National days like Jamhuri should be occasions for soul-searching and stock-taking. There are ample reasons to doubt that we do that, which is why too many people are giving in to pessimism.
Nurses’ strike
Right now, we are in the midst of a strike by nurses and clinicians. These grievances have consistently been ignored by the authorities, even after seven months of a worsening global pandemic.





In the next 10 days, unless there is urgent intervention, doctors will join the strike. What then happens to the millions of poor Kenyans being denied medical attention?
To paraphrase a politician I used to admire, it is the government’s duty to provide basic needs to the vulnerable, among them affordable health services, water and sanitation, education, housing and food.
Taking stock would entail looking at all these needs and how they have been handled in the past three decades, and so far, the record has been abysmal, though to be sure, our leaders always talk about their urgency.
What seems to be the problem? Two major hurdles, it appears, always stand in the way of their fulfilment—ceaseless jostling for political power and mind-numbing corruption.

However, in another sense, things cannot be as bleak as they appear on the surface. We, indeed, have come far from those days when our parents struggled against colonial rule, and although the country is still among the least developed in the world, those who complain that we were better off at Independence are spouting self-serving propaganda for argument’s sake.
We may not be where we should be after 57 years of self-rule, but we are not yet a failed state. Nor shall we, hopefully, be in the near future, for we are a fairly resilient society.
However, unless things change, it will be a near thing. Last Saturday, I was privileged to join a number of fellow elders at a relative’s bride price ceremony. It was actually nothing more than a formal recognition of an already existing union, so we didn’t have to negotiate a reasonable deal, and all we had to do was to make witty speeches, pray, praise and eat.
Poverty
However, I was more interested in investigating my surroundings and finding out how other people live and was puzzled at the level of poverty I saw in an otherwise verdant environment.
Tucked somewhere about seven kilometres from Gatundu town in Kiambu County is a nondescript settlement that’s famous for nothing at all except that its dwellers grow Kenya’s favourite beverage, tea, in huge quantities.

However, few of those I saw at Gitwe seem to have benefited at all from the crop, though there is a leaf collection centre nearby and lorry-loads of the commodity are daily transported there. It appears the majority of the dwellers missed out on the Kenyan dream while a few made it big – very big.
I sought to understand why the high levels of poverty amid such lush greenery, but then it occurred to me that what I was seeing was an illusion; ordinary farmers do not own any of the plantations.
 Indeed, the majority spend their days plucking tea leaves for meagre wages, while even the small growers who do own plots under tea are not much better off, for when they send their produce to the collection centres they are usually robbed blind at every stage of the process and forced to lead a precarious hand-to-mouth existence.
This anecdote serves to illustrate one important truth; national holidays are increasingly becoming irrelevant in people’s lives but their leaders do not know it. When I cheekily sought to know from a group of shabby individuals I accosted in the locality’s tiny shopping centre how they planned to celebrate Jamhuri Day, the response was explosive.
“What is Jamhuri? You tycoons from Nairobi can go ahead and celebrate. Tell Uhuru the children are still at home since March and there is no food for them.”

Despite remonstrating that I am neither a mdosi from Nairobi nor do I, ordinarily, hobnob with presidents over anything at all, they were not convinced and I had to part with Sh200 so they could buy mugfuls of stronger stuff than tea to mollify them.
This means that the much-hyped development has never trickled down to the very poor and they don’t see why they should be excited about national days or stuff like the Building Bridges Initiative, which they hardly understand.

BBI secretariat cleaned up the 5.2 million signatures that endorsed the Bill, and weeded out 800,000 that had entry irregularities. This comes days after he collapsed at a hotel in Nairobi and was placed under intensive care at Nairobi Hospital.
