Late Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama, who succumbed to Covid-19 complications last Friday, will be buried on Thursday December 24, 2020 at his Tente home.
Before that, there will be an interdenominational prayer service on Wednesday December 23, 2020 at Nyamira Primary School grounds at 10am. 
The committee planning the governor’s burial said the decision had been arrived at after broad deliberations and consultations.

Nyagarama, 74, died at the Nairobi Hospital where he had been admitted for about a month.
Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiang’i and Kisii Governor James Ongwae are leading the team that is planning a State burial for the late governor.
A statement from the Office of the President last Friday said Gusii community leaders unanimously agreed to have the duo as co-chairpersons of the burial committee.





Senator Okong’o O’Mogeni and North Mugirango MP Joash Nyamoko are the vice chairpersons while Nyamira County Women Rep Jerusha Momanyi is the Treasurer.
The committee that is liasing with the governor’s family selected Nyagarama’s Tente home, which is among three rural homes belonging to the late county boss, as his final resting place.
He lived with his second wife Naomi in this home which is within Nyamira Municipality.
The governor’s first wife, Dorcas Sigara, died in 1998 and her remains were interred at their Mosobeti home in Kitutu Masaba constituency, Nyamira county.
Their elder son, George Ndemo Nyagarama, died on June 11, 2018 after a long illness and was buried at their Riamanoti home in Borabu Constituency, Nyamira County.
The committee has co-opted all legislators from Nyamira and Kisii counties with a view to keep residents informed about burial plans.

According to the committee, more details on the final rites will be communicated to the public in due course.  The team, made up of four people picked from counties bordering Nyamira, will be chaired by Kisii Governor James Ongwae. His family says he had difficulty breathing after his lungs collapsed. The decision also means that his house arrest is no longer valid. The work boycott, the union said, will continue for as long as it needs to. The March 9, 2018 handshake between Uhuru and Raila and the Tangatanga and Kieleweke politics will be at play in the Sonko succession
