Over 64, 40-foot containers will be housed at the Park expected to attract very important personalities from car manufacturers, diplomats to business magnates.A special mixed zone for mandatory media interviews has been created while the WRC Safari team has identified the KWS land opposite the institute, as the parking area for the fans. The World Rally Championship Safari Rally route will be certified by the International Automobile federation (FIA) in the coming weeks.
As I indicated in this column last week, the rally has a mixture of “bad” and “good” roads. 
Diversions have been created in straight stretches at the Soysambu Conservancy to reduce speeds that are likely to hit over 200 kilometres per hour.

The rally will zoom off outside its traditional starting point at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) on June 24, a big plus for Kenya as the WRC Promoter will be able to capture the Nairobi skyline pictures portraying a modern metropolis, before the 50 competitors head to the Kasarani Stadium for side-by-side racing in the four-kilometre Super Special Stage.
This is the perfect opportunity for rally fans residing in Nairobi and neighbouring areas to watch the action from close quarters.

Unlike in the past, this will be the only rally action of the day before the cars head to the Kenya Wildlife Service Training Institute in Naivasha, 90 kilometres west of Nairobi, which will be home for the Safari for the following three days.
More Kenyans will also follow the Safari on television in a WRC Promoter high-end production in real time in some sections.  
Proper action resumes on Friday in the expansive Soysambu Conservancy. Cars will enter the rally route on the left at Kikopey Shopping Centre, two kilometres from Gilgil town renowned for mouth-watering Nyama Choma offerings.
Route designers — Gurvi Bhabra, Nazir Yakub, George Mwangi and Anwar Sidi  — have identified several spectator zones at Soysambu and Elmentaita in the east and an open field near Kenya Pipeline Depot overlooking Lion Hills, 10 kilometres westward from Nakuru town.

googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



It is advisable for the fans to arrive early on Friday and head to the designated spectator zones as the rest of the Safari route will be closed for the public.
This will be a day-long of activities and perfect family outing as the drivers will repeat Soysambu, Elmentaita and Sleeping Warrior sections twice before returning to Naivasha.
To say Soysambu will be easy is an understatement.There are many speed traps to slow drivers.
However, the Sleeping Warrior Hill, named the same as it resembles a warrior sleeping, has all the ingredients of the old Safari —  rocky and hilly. Elmentaita, which ends by the lake side, is a new addition and extremely rocky in some sections before ending in the buffalo and giraffe’s kingdom.
This section will sell Kenya as a tourism destination in global television to an estimated 70 million audience. It will be a marketing coup which cannot be recreated in foreign tourism exhibition.
It is from this perspective that the Kenya Tourism Board and Magical Kenya should milk the Safari as an addition of their traditional packages.
The Safari format has changed over time as the FIA has given safety premium consideration.

This has affected the media, especially photographers, who will also work only in designated areas at a safe distance from the rally route.

});
}, 62000);
}



The rally team has produced media safety guides highlighting areas with the best action shots for every competitive section, complete with elevations and mobile telephones signals strength.
Indiscipline, like what was seen in Australia in 2018 where a fan was taking pictures close to the road, will not be entertained. These media section will be manned by safety marshals and anybody who crosses the official lines will be reported to the police.
The FIA considers a media accreditation card as a working tool and any abuse of this document can easily jeopardise one’s future applications.
From Gilgil, the cars will return to the KWS Training Institute where fans will easily mingle with the drivers.
The park is taking shape with tarmac surfaces in place and enough room for the Safari Village where fans will follow action in the field from giant TV monitors throughout the duration of the Safari.
Over 64, 40-foot containers will be housed at the Park expected to attract very important personalities from car manufacturers, diplomats to business magnates.
A special mixed zone for mandatory media interviews has been created while the WRC Safari team has identified the KWS land opposite the institute, as the parking area for the fans.
