The changes are part of a new grading system that was approved by the Public Service Commission in a move aimed at harmonising prison staff pay with that of the National Police Service.
To align the two salaries structures, the Kenya Prisons Service was forced to collapse two ranks – the senior assistant commissioner and senior deputy commissioner of prisons.
That saw 14 ranks retained out of the previous 16, with the rank of the commissioner general being the senior most.

Mr Ogalo spoke while addressing senior staff at Magereza House, the prisons headquarters, during a thanksgiving service. He thanked the staff for their service throughout the challenging year that saw the department hit by Covid-19 , both at the prison headquarters and in various prisons.
Deputy Commissioner General of Prisons Florence Momanyi disclosed that at some point she and a few other staff house tested positive for Covid, forcing the headquarters to be closed for two weeks.
