Mr Mburukuwa said that the girl was found lying on her stomach with a loose green bedsheet covering the back of her neck.
He noted that another piece of the bedsheet was also hanging from the joist approximately three meters from the floor. 
"General physical appearance on the deceased showed a round bruise on the neck noting that she was strangled. The belly had also protruded." The police boss said.
Mr Michael Eleman, landlord, said that at around 6am he was awaken by a loud cry for help from one of his tenants' house.





Mr Eleman said that before he could reach to the specific house, he saw his tenant, Victor Ekal, 25, moving out of his house in a hurry.
"Ekal fled using a motorcycle without number plate at a high speed. When I entered the house, I  found a girl lying lifeless on the floor. I quickly rushed to the Lodwar Police Station to report," the landlord said.
The landlord said that he had little information about the tenant, who he said for the two months he has been staying in the house was coming home late before curfew hours and leaving early morning.
The police boss said that the man was still at large.
The body of the deceased was moved to Lodwar County and Referral Hospital Mortuary awaiting autopsy.

Gender-Based Violence 
The incident has happened just after marking 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence which is an international campaign to challenge violence against women and girls from November 25 to December 10.
In Turkana, the campaign, which was spearheaded by International Rescue Committee organization, culminated with establishment a safe center for victims of sexual and gender based violence at Nakwamekwi in the outskirts of Lodwar town, Turkana Central Sub County.
According to IRC Senior Women Protection and Empowerment Officer Adet Tebi, the community safe space will be offering psychological counselling services for affected girls and women.
"Besides being physically and emotionally secure, the center has been equipped to ensure the women have a forum to learn technical skills like tailoring, baking, hairdressing and beading to enhance their livelihoods." Ms Tebi said.
He said the center will not only benefit SGBV survivors but also open to other women across the county seeking to freely acquire income generating activities.
County Health Executive Jane Ajele noted that centre came as a result of a county survey, which revealed that women in Turkana did not have a space to talk about what they are going through.

"We acknowledge IRC for seeing the gap and collaborating with Diocese of Lodwar to renovate abandoned structures at the Nakwamekwi church and handing it over to women.





The centre will play a crucial role in facilitating the entry of women and girls into vocational training and acquisition of practical skills such as embroidery, beadwork, bakery, fashion and design for self-empowerment." Ms Ajele said.
The county official added that though many women had experienced all sorts of abuse not only at home but also in the community, the existing platforms were male-dominated hence worsening the already sorry situation.  A post-mortem report shows the two victims may have died of injuries inflicted at the police station. In sentencing the accused, Justice Reuben Nyakundi said the murder was well planned and executed. He served in former president Daniel Moi's cabinet. BBI secretariat cleaned up the 5.2 million signatures that endorsed the Bill, and weeded out 800,000 that had entry irregularities. This comes days after he collapsed at a hotel in Nairobi and was placed under intensive care at Nairobi Hospital.
