Moi University, for instance, has lost five staff to the disease since universities and colleges reopened for phased learning in October. These include two lecturers and three non-academic staff in the health and central services at the School of Health Science and its main campus at Kesses.
The university’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr Paul Binot, disclosed that 35 Covid-19 cases had been recorded among post-graduate and undergraduate students since they resumed learning in October.





“The numbers have been climbing slowly but we’ve been quite lucky that they are still low. Most of them, (students) had mild symptoms and did not require hospitalisation. We had only one student who was admitted but has since been discharged,” Dr Binot told Higher Education.
He added, “We have had more than 20 members of staff who tested positive for Covid-19, majority of them have done well and have gone home but unfortunately we lost five of them.”
Wearing  face masks
Dr Binot observed that the university introduced a number of measures that included mandatory wearing of face masks, setting up of water points and minimising the number of students in lecture halls. The university has also put up 12 isolation beds in its main campus and six beds at the School of Health Sciences.

Dr Binot added that to minimize infection, the university had minimise face-to face learning and embraced online learning.
At Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology, although there have been no deaths linked to Covid-19, the university has handled several cases of students who have been taken ill after presenting symptoms associated with the disease. The university has set up an isolation centre for students suspected of having been infected with the coronavirus, however, it is facing a challenge in testing students due to lack of reagents and testing kits.
To avoid the spread of infections at the institution, examinations for doctorate and master’s students were administered online. Students who are involved in practicals are allowed to learn in small groups while observing social distancing.
