The network would also seek to develop the agriculture value chains and create partnerships with the national and county governments, and development partners to implement the ten-year Agricultural Sector Transformation and Growth Strategy (ASTGS).
Asnet chairman Bimal Kantaria said the launch of the document would help the sector overcome adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic that have affected productivity in the industry.
“The country’s agriculture sector can do even better despite the gloominess that the Covid-19 pandemic appears to portend,” he said, expressing optimism in the capability of Asnet to drive the change that will actualise the ASTGS.

Newly appointed Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) representative to Kenya, Carla Mucavi, lauded the move by the private sector to facilitate the streamlining of the country’s agriculture sector through the launch of the strategy that would run from 2021-2024.
She said FAO considers the private sector a key ally in the fight against hunger and food insecurity.
Fisheries PS Micheni Ntiba, who attended the event, called for more participation in deep-sea and ocean fisheries, restating that the government pledged its support for the sub-sector.
