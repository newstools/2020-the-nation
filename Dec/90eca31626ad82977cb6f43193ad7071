With coronavirus deaths worldwide numbering a million and a half and rising, it may seem out of place to mourn individuals most of us never knew.
But simply by bringing their works and achievements into our lives, modern communications can make some headliners seem almost like friends.
We have enjoyed their amazing talents and we are grateful for the pleasure they have given us, so surely to grieve at their passing is only natural.

I’m prompted to these thoughts by the death last week at 90 years of John Le Carre, that most marvellous of all writers of espionage thrillers, tales such as Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, as well as Smiley’s People, The Spy Who Came in From The Cold and a dozen or so more.
Sir Alec Guiness
Many of this British ex-diplomat’s works were turned into movies and television serials and who can ever forget Sir Alec Guinness, as the ineffable, soft-spoken agent, George Smiley?

}



Old man Time’s scythe reaped a notable harvest of high-flyers in 2020, including the portrayer of quite another sort of spy to those of Smiley’s world.
I refer to Sean Connery, the first and best of the actors who played James Bond, the glamorous, insouciant 007 of Ian Fleming’s many books.
Connery, a Scot, as tough in real life as any Bond, died at age 90, leaving an indelible mark in popular espionage mythology.
Among other 2020 departures from the entertainment world who held a special place in the affections of the people of this country were Vera Lynn and Barbara Windsor.
The former was a hugely popular singer during World War II, known as the Forces’ Sweetheart and famed for her keynote number, There’ll Be Blue Birds Over the White Cliffs of Dover. She lived to an extraordinary 103.

Lovers of the game
Barbara Windsor, known to her friends as “Babs”, was the perky, ever-smiling star of the Carry On films and later played Peggy Mitchell, a pub landlady, in the long-running BBC TV soap opera EastEnders.
“Babs” suffered from Alzheimer’s Disease in the last six years of her life and was 83 at her death.
My personal mourning list would include footballers who thrilled lovers of the game worldwide.
From my own part of the world, there was the down-to-earth defender-without-frills Jack Charlton; from Italy, the hero of the 1982 World Cup Paulo Rossi; and finally, yes, Diego Maradona from Argentina, despite all the hoo-ha of his infamous “Hand of God” against England in 1986, the greatest of them all, and only 60.
God bless and may they rest in peace.

One of the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic has been that more people now cycle to work, resulting in an increase in the value of bicycles and their attractiveness to thieves.
Police in the City of London, an area of many office workers, set a trap for the bicycle thieves.
They used a cycle as bait, locking it to a rack outside an office block. It was promptly stolen, with an angle grinder used to slice through the lock in seconds.

Police crackdown
A tracker led the police to business premises five miles away in Tower Hamlets, east London.
 There, they found 60 stolen bicycles, some of them designer models worth thousands of pounds.
Three men were arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods.
The police crackdown included the use of officers in plain clothes to watch known hot spots.
In one month, 80 machines were recovered and angle grinders and bolt cutters confiscated.

The gremlins were at it again last week (well, that’s who editors always blame).
Referring to a reversal of opinion in regard to Brexit, the story said a poll had shown 74 per cent of Britons would now vote to remain in Europe against 67 per cent who would still leave.
Sharp-eyed reader
As sharp-eyed reader Helen pointed out, a percentage cannot exceed 100, so one or both of those figures had to be wrong.
Just to clarify, here are the results of another sampling of opinion, by Deltapoll, which asked, “If there were another referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union, how would you vote?”
The scores: Remain in Europe 47 per cent, Leave 40 per cent, Don’t know 13 per cent.

What doctors say and what they mean:
If the symptoms persist, call for an appointment. (I’m going on holiday for a month.)

If it doesn’t clear up in a week, give me a call. (I haven’t a clue, maybe it will just go away.)
This may hurt a little. (This could make you bite your tongue off.)

“Okay,” he said, “but if you get home before I do, leave the hallway light on.”
