Doctors' plight
The ministry said it has taken note of concerns raised by health workers, following the death of yet another doctor, 28-year-old Stephen Mogusu, who succumbed to Covid-19 complications on Monday.
CAS Mwangangi said the dialogue continues and that issues such as payment of outstanding salaries will be prioritised.

Regarding personal protective equipment, she said counties have been advised to obtain them locally at prevailing market rates.
While thanking the Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) for suspending its strike until December 21, to allow negotiations with the government, she asked other unions to follow suit.
"A pandemic such as the one we are in is equal to a war and health workers are the frontline soldiers on the ground," Dr Mwangangi noted.
"This is not the time to deny our people much-needed medical attention, as doing so would be tantamount to leaving them open to an attack by the enemy." The virus has had a far-reaching effects on lives and livelihoods in Africa. Dr Stephen mogusu, a father of one, did not have medical insurance despite working in a high-risk centre.
