Politician Musalia Mudavadi has warned of a possible paralysis in the public service if the country does not end debate on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).
The Amani National Congress party leader said this debate has been the order of the day, hence the need to conclude the process as soon as possible.

Mr Mudavadi said the debate should not overtake crucial matters that will see the country get back on its feet.
“The reason why I want this process concluded as soon as possible relates to an outcome that will make all Kenyans happy [about insulation from the] bad manners of politicians who incite them against anything and everything, while plotting how to benefit from such outcomes,” he said on Saturday during former minister Joseph Nyagah's funeral ceremony in Mbeere, Embu County.
He said it appears all the energy has been channeled towards the BBI, “as if it is the alpha and omega of all the problems affecting the country”, making Kenyans think it is their "sole redeemer" and the perfect solution to their problems.





“Let us make our civil service work because the debate around the BBI has gone on and on [for too long]. we have reached a stage where public service has been paralysed as people wonder ‘are you pro-BBI or anti-BBI’,” he said.
Key among the perennial problems haunting Kenya at the moment is the health workers’ strike, which has already paralysed operations in public hospitals across the country.
On Saturday, the Kenya Medical practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) said a doctors’ strike, which had been suspended for talks with the government, will begin as planned on Monday as their issues remain unresolved.

Meanwhile, many counties have resorted to bank overdrafts to pay employees due to the government’s delay to disburse Sh60 million for the months of October, November and December.
New Year hope
The ANC leader noted that for three years now, Kenyans have been treated to the theatrics of the BBI at the expense of critical issues.
He warned that if the BBI debate continues to be the “daily song when the New Year begins, the country might get into trouble by not putting its priorities right”.
“Let us close this debate in a very well-organised way, having incorporated broad consensus, so that this matter can be behind us … so that we can unite again as Kenyans and focus on the recovery of the economy. That should be our singular goal,” he said.
Mr Mudavadi said Kenyans should now be looking for ways for everybody to benefit from an economic revival, through creation of jobs and capacity buildings in sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing and small and medium enterprises.
He called on leaders, particularly the political class, to embrace broader dialogue for the sake of a win-win outcome in order to avoid dividing the country along political and tribal lines.
“This is Kenya. Let us make ourselves truly Kenyan. Let us unite and not be divisive. Let us build a broader consensus on key issues. Let us walk away from this notion that if you have a different opinion from mine you are my enemy,” the ANC boss said, also noting the need to elect worthy leaders in the 2022 General Election.

“Every Kenyan’s life matters. That’s why the country should reflect on where it has come from and have a vision of hope as we [head to the 2022 election],” he said.
