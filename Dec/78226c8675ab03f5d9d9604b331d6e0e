The songwriter and actress landed at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in Nairobi on Monday and proceeded to the posh Hemingways Nairobi, a five-star hotel located in Karen.
The Grammy Award winner has been sharing with her fans her exciting experiences in Kenya through videos and photos on Instagram and even described Kenya as “the motherland”.
In another clip, she is heard saying she is not getting out of the vehicle after she saw a buffalo nearby while on a trip to the Nairobi National Park.





“That’s close, I am definitely not getting out,” she is heard saying.
But eventually, she does step out and shoots a few videos which, however, did not go down well with Kenyans online who accused her of breaking park rules by leaving her tour van.
The US celebrity also posed for pictures with park rangers and captioned it “Protected”.
Ashanti is accompanied by New York City-based content creator Jay Richardson alias LiveRichMedia, who also took to Instagram and posted, “I only like to travel with independent women.”
The singer also took her time and visited Giraffe Manor, one of the most exclusive hotels in the upmarket Karen neighbourhood.
She, as she has been doing since she landed in the country, shared a series of clips of herself at Giraffe Manor and also got the chance to feed a Rothschild’s giraffe in one video and shared a snap of herself giving snacks to the magnificent animals.

Travel advisory
Her visit comes barely a week after the US, through the Centres for Disease Control (CDC), warned American citizens against travelling to Kenya due to a high risk of contracting Covid-19.
CDC, in an updated health notice last week on Wednesday, warned American citizens against non-essential visits to Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Burundi.
CDC placed the four nations under Level 4 Alert, meaning there is a very high level of Covid-19 infections and all non-essential travel should be avoided.
“Travellers should avoid all travel to Kenya. Travel may increase your chance of getting and spreading Covid-19,” said CDC in a notice.
If one must travel to these countries, they were advised to strictly adhere to health protocols on Covid-19, including wearing masks and keeping a six feet distance from other people.
“Travel may increase your chance of getting and spreading Covid-19,” stated the US health institute on its website.
In most of the content Ashanti has posted, she is not captured wearing a face mask.
“During travel, wear a mask, stay at least six feet from people who are not travelling with you, wash your hands often or use hand sanitiser, and watch your health for signs of illness,” the CDC notice read.

Ashanti’s visit comes a few days before her most anticipated Verzuz battle with fellow RnB singer Keyshia Cole slated for Saturday, December 12, 2020.
She joins the long list of international celebrities who have recently visited the country, including American superstar singers Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato, Canadian YouTuber Lilly Singh, as well as supermodel Naomi Campbell. Residents of Mombasa have been eagerly waiting the commissioning of the bridge. Ms Nthenya was freed without any charges being preferred against her. Just last week, Justice James Rika recused himself from the case after tempers flared in court.
