Covid-19 fears
However, the Ethiopia House of Federation (HOF), the country's upper house of parliament approved a recommendation in June 2020 to postpone the national elections, citing the health threat posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Ethiopia had as of Friday morning recorded 121,399 Covid-19 cases and 1,882 Covid-19 related deaths.
Ethiopia holds regular parliamentary and regional council elections every five years with the 2015 polls completely won by the ruling coalition Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and allied parties.
The 2021 polls will be keenly watched by local and foreign observers, with the newly rebranded ruling party, now called Prosperity Party (PP), expected to face a stiff electoral challenge from opposition parties.
