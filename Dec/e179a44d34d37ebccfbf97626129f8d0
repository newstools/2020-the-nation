President Kenyatta also rubbished claims that the BBI is aimed at creating additional seats for a select few.  President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday took the BBI charm offensive to the youth — a group critical in passing the document due to its large numbers — and asked them to support the plan to amend the Constitution “for a better future and country”.
The Head of State, who was speaking to a group of youths at the Bomas of Kenya, said the BBI document had placed them at its centre. He added that the report is key in addressing some of the problems that have bedevilled the country, including high unemployment rate among young people.

President Kenyatta also rubbished claims that the BBI is aimed at creating additional seats for a select few, insisting that every Kenyan will have a chance to be represented and to contest for any position they wish to contest for regardless of their ethnicity, gender or race.





“What we are trying to achieve in Kenya is to ensure that no single Kenyan never again feels left out to the point that they want to become violent to achieve their objective,” he said.
Change the Constitution
“And that is why one of the critical components of the BBI is to ensure that we entrench in law bills that will ensure the youth are adequately catered for. And that is why we need the youth policy going out, so that we ensure the youth are at the centre of any developmental programmes in our country.”
The President said the quest to change the Constitution, had been informed by the cycle of election violence witnessed every voting year —a situation he said was catalysed by the winner take it all arrangement — but which had disenfranchised the youth, who were mostly used as conduits by the political elite to fan the violence.
The President said the BBI is not only aimed at addressing this problem by creating more seats that would be shared equitably, but also rope in the youth into positions of leadership and power. “We want our young people also involved in decision-making bodies all the way from county assemblies to the National Assembly.”

The President, who spoke during the unveiling of the KenyaNiMimi youth campaign, said the 2018 handshake with ODM leader Raila Odinga was a testament of what the country could achieve should it adopt the proposed constitutional changes, by embracing the politics of ideologies, versus that of hate and negative ethnicity.
“From that handshake , you have seen the peace that has prevailed in this country and the manner in which we have been able to work together because our agendas and not that different.”
The KenyaNiMimi campaign, launched by Youth Affairs ministry in partnership with the United Nations Population Fund, aims to bring young people together to promote their health and well-being.
