Allegations of voter intimidation and bribery marred the Dabaso Ward by-election in Kilifi County on Tuesday.
There was also choas at the Dabaso Primary School polling centre, which forced security personnel to disperse crowds.
The Dabaso MCA seat fell vacant after the High Court nullified the August 7, 2017 election of Emmanuel Changawa of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM).

Mr Changawa is currently vying for the seat on a Movement for Democracy and Growth (MDG) party ticket following his defeat by ODM’s Dickson Karani during the party’s primaries.
Mr Karani contested the 2017 election at the High Court, a move that led to the nullification of the exercise and an order for a fresh vote to take place.
Baya's claims
Trouble started on Tuesday after Kilifi North MP Owen Baya claimed, after voting at Dabaso Primary School, that ODM had deployed goons in four Land Cruisers to intimidate voters.

});
}, 62000);
}



Speaking to the press, Mr Baya said they would not allow ODM members to intimidate their candidate and called on security forces to do their work effectively .
“We have reports of ODM members intimidating people with a view to keeping them away from polling stations. We shall not allow it,” he said.
Mr Baya claimed the goons focused on Mr Changawa’s strongholds in order to keep his supporters from voting.
"The ODM goons invaded a shop at the Rising Sun Primary School polling centre and looted food because it is owned by a person who does not support ODM," he said.
He did not give proof to support his allegations.
Other allegations
Later, three women led by former MCA Barke Mohamed, who is also the Kilifi County Women’s League chair, stood outside the Dabaso polling station, saying they were there to check on their agents.

Police officers stepped in as youths began picking up sticks, apparently to use them to attack Ms Mohamed and her two colleagues, after Mr Baya asked them to clear crowds outside the polling center.
At the Mijomboni Primary School polling station, ODM Youth Coordinator Nyundo Samir almost clashed with Mr Abdulrahman Omar, a former Ganda MCA, who is supporting Mr Changawa.
Mr Samir accused the former MCA of being among those who were dishing out money to people in order for them to vote for Mr Changawa.
“We have heard of people dishing out money. If we find them they will regret it,” he said.
He advised the people to return home after voting and wait there for the outcome of the election to be announced.
On his part, Mr Omar claimed ODM ferried 30 vehicles, among them two buses, full of goons from Kilifi and Nairobi to intimidate and harass voters.
Mr Hillary Kombe, the Dabaso Ward Returning Officer, said the ward has 12,620 voters, registered at 22 polling stations spread across 10 polling centres.
