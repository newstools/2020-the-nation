The companies that make these vaccines are making various claims about the success of their vaccines.Pfizer’s trial involved 43,000 people, 170 of whom contracted Covid-19, but 162 were not vaccinated, while eight were vaccinated, accounting for 95 per cent of the vaccine. What is your opinion on the Covid-19 vaccine, and how successful will it be? Will we get a choice? Some people may have a choice, but a majority will likely get what is available. There may be over five billion doses of a potential vaccine needed. You may need to wait sometime to get any vaccine.
We have no real idea when the vaccines will be available. Governments are now signing agreements to get whatever vaccines may be available if they get approval for general distribution. There is also the matter of priority. Healthcare workers and the elderly should be the priority.

You may also need testing to make sure you have effective immunity. If not, you may need to try another vaccine. Or another dose. If you understand the history of vaccines, creating a Covid-19 vaccine will be a lifetime achievement. This is not just about winning the Olympic gold medal. That is if a specific decisive vaccine is created, causing the disease to be rendered inert.

Polio vaccine
Vaccines for any significant disease can take up to 10 years to research, trial and reach the public. It took 47 years to make the polio vaccine, 42 years to make the chickenpox vaccine, 43 years to make the Ebola vaccine, 13 years to make the hepatitis B vaccine, and it took H.P. I.  61 years after first being discovered, Aids has not been cured yet.
 In the last 200 years, only smallpox has been eradicated. Also, no human infectious disease has yet been eradicated, but scientists worldwide are now working to eliminate the Coronavirus. The vaccine has been developed in just 10 months, with many candidates being developed around the world.
The companies that make these vaccines are making various claims about the success of their vaccines.
Pfizer claims to be up to 95 per cent effective in its vaccines. Moderna claims it is 94.5 per cent successful, Russia’s Sputnik V says it’s at 95 per cent, Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccines at 90 per cent and Covaxin being developed in India at 60 per cent.

Third phase of the trial
All these results have come from the third phase of the trial conducted in a controlled environment, but its success rate will fall when it reaches the general public. Because people are divided into two groups during the trial, half of them are vaccinated, and half are not.
Pfizer’s trial involved 43,000 people, 170 of whom contracted Covid-19, but 162 were not vaccinated, while eight were vaccinated, accounting for 95 per cent of the vaccine.
The vaccine has been claimed to be successful, but its effectiveness was not significant. Efficacy means that during the trial, the vaccine was found to cure people up to 95 per cent. The people involved in the trial are usually healthy. They do not already have a serious illness.
When the same vaccine is given to millions of people worldwide, the real effect will be known because, according to The Lancet Medical Journal, 95 per cent of the world’s population already have some form of the disease. That will accurately determine the percentage of their success in different people and in different situations.





Countries have started preparing to buy these vaccines, but all the nations will provide them to only 20 to 25 per cent of the people in the next year.

In the first phase, the vaccine will be given to healthcare workers, the second phase will be provided to social care workers, the third phase will be provided to people over 65, and the fourth phase will be provided to the public.
The vaccine usually needs to be stored at a temperature of two to three degrees Celsius.  This will not be challenging to maintain in rich countries, but in poor and developing countries where resources are scarce and power is insufficient, storing them can be a daunting task.
