Last week, I observed the emerging government condition of spectacular ineffectiveness in the face of monstrously engorged ministerial clout.
I argued that the burgeoning VIP culture signifies the consolidation of a baronial class, who no longer view themselves as the president’s subordinates, exercising borrowed executive power on his behalf, to serve the people of Kenya.

}, 62000);
}



Instead, they see themselves as active contenders vying with the political class for the opportunity to lord it over Kenyans and gratify their base physiological imperatives.
This is the only inference the reasonable mind may arrive at, after examining our public affairs, however briefly. Kenyans are not feeling served, respected or even seen by their government, despite the deployment of incredibly powerful ministerial power and expenditure of stupendous amounts of public funds.

Despite the stated intention to invest these funds to secure historic economic growth, it seems that the only growth sectors are repression, suffering, debt and corruption.
Monumental investment
The people strategically empowered to steward this monumental investment to achieve national transformation have forgotten themselves and embarked on frolics of their own.
Reports that the president’s directives are often disregarded with impunity indicate a cardinal instance of the emerging baronial insolence. On what conceivable basis could a bureaucrat contemplate disobeying the Head of State?
A key directive in question regards the adoption of an online procurement system. In the President’s own words, “This would enhance the highest level of public scrutiny at all units of public administration, and improve the management of public resources for public good”.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {

Stated in 2015, this intention would have had the effect of enhancing transparency and exposing the cartels who continue to devour the state.
Public procurement systems are not mundane bureaucratic quibbles. Nearly all public expenditure has an element of procurement. Over 50 per cent of the public budget goes to procurement. Procurement is the node where public budgets as public policy instruments find expression in terms of actual provision of citizen services.
A corrupted public procurement system perverts this node, so that procurement becomes the expression of the private interests of bandits.
As early as 2014, corruption was estimated to cost the country Sh635 billion. When the Head of Public Service made this revelation all those years ago, a good number of Kenyans thought he had exaggerated it a bit. Not anymore. Given the stampeding ruthlessness of present corruption, there is actually good reason to believe that the level is much higher.
All budgetary expenditures are made through MDAs — ministries, departments and agencies — which are presided over by Cabinet secretaries.
All public procurement, through which cartels siphon billions of shillings, take place right under the purview of Cabinet secretaries.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {

});
}, 62000);
}








Granted, they are formally not allowed to interfere in procurement matters. Yet, their policy and strategic leadership must surely be counted upon to create and maintain corruption-free programmes and projects. Moreover, non-participation in procurement affairs does not in any way impair their corruption prevention mandate.
In any event, a lot of MDA corruption invariably bear the telltale fingerprints of presiding officers. Every instance displays the unmistakable “handwriting” of ministerial complicity, collusion or arms-length participation.
The President has been a lone, despairing voice in the war on corruption. The silence of virtually the entire Cabinet, outside the disembodied and reluctant rote of prepared remarks, is truly startling.
Sh635 billion
The cumulative anti-corruption energy of sub-presidential Cabinet is an uninspiring and abject whimper, a neglected, dwindling flicker. If the President promotes the formal and de jure anti-corruption policy in word, his Cabinet project an informal, de facto corruption policy. I do not think it is wise to open bets on who is winning. Suffice it to say it is not a good look.
It would be lovely to be utterly mistaken on this matter, and I would relish the occasion to take back my words.

But the facts suggest I haven’t scratched the surface of the problem. Some Sh635 billion lost through MDAs, and nary a voice raised in outrage or admonition by our ministers, who meanwhile continue to voraciously amass privilege, is a most damning report on the state of our nation.
All 47 counties were allocated Sh316 billion this year. This is the sort of money invested in the very visible transformation of our countryside, as well as the dramatic and scandalous excesses of our local leaders.
Through MDAs, we lose the equivalent of two years’ allocation to all counties to private pockets. Cartels consume twice every year what legitimate county governments get in one year.
Perhaps these cartels invest their proceeds in funds that subscribe in our international bonds, so that we keep paying them. Anglo Leasing was modelled that way: steal-lending. In any event, the kind of monster we are fattening with all this corruption is bound to be extremely devastating once it gets going.

It will all end in tears.
