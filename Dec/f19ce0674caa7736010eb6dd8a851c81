Former Kaloleni legislator Gunga Mwinga has passed away. 
He died Sunday morning at Mombasa Hospital where he had been admitted, the family confirmed. 
The former MP had been admitted at the facility for a week.
His uncle, Mr Fredrick Kahindi, said the ex-legislator died at around 3.45am.

Reports indicate he was admitted at the hospital on December 24, forcing him to spend Christmas at the facility. 
"We are now going to start burial preparations," he added.
Mr Mwinga was the MP for Kaloleni for one term where he served from 2013 to 2017. He lost his seat to current area MP Paul Katana.
Mr Katana joined the family at the hospital where he also hared his condolences and termed the former MP as a brave leader.
