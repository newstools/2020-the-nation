“The governor has been receiving money each year to construct a county headquarter and residence. Since 2013, we have appropriated funds on the item of construction of the county headquarters. Where does he take the money?” posed Davins Onuso, the Deputy Speaker.
The premise, which hosts the governor, is gazetted as the Kisii County Assembly precincts and the governor requested in 2013 to use it as a temporary office as he renovated the treasury premises.
He has since stayed at the buildings.

Last week, a motion to impeach the Speaker ended prematurely before tallying and vote counting was done after chaos broke out.
Acting Speaker, Samuel Onuko , who is also the MCA for Boochi Borabu, adjourned the House to this week and deferred the motion of impeachment. 
The members accused the governor of using his enforcement officers to scuttle peaceful and constitutional work which they were elected to perform.
The governor is alleged to be supporting the embattled Speaker.
“We are aware of underhand tactics being employed to scuttle a constitutional assembly from transacting its business. We will not be intimidated to supporting a speaker who has failed to serve the assembly that he swore to protect and now serving interests of the governor,” said Mr Onuko.

Impeachment motion 
The impeachment motion was moved by Bogiakumu MCA Ishmael Matundura, who cited abuse of office, corruption and gross misconduct.
The motion mover also cited the Speaker's failure to procure group life insurance and group accident cover for the members. 
MCAs discovered the two policies were not paid for when the Kiamokama ward MCA Ken Mainya died and his family was not compensated as per the policy. The money for the policies was factored in the budget. 
Members of the assembly then proceeded to the regional Ethics and Anti-Corruption offices to register their frustrations and sought for the anti-graft agency to intervene. 
The members have also petitioned the Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiangi to intervene and restore sanity in the assembly.
On Tuesday, three vehicles belonging to MCAs were destroyed by hired goons who attacked them after concluding the day’s session. 
“The CS should know that as the head of the police this is the time for him to show leadership and apprehend the officers who slept on their job and allowed goons to access the precincts of the assembly - a protected area - to harm and cause mayhem to members of the assembly who were peacefully doing their business," the acting Speaker said.

"The CS is a son of Kisii and therefore we seek his intervention and save the Kisii people whom we represent. We wish to assure residents of Kisii that the County Assembly of Kisii will continue to discharge its mandate and will represent, legislate and oversight for them as per the constitution. No amount of intimidation is going to stop us from doing our rightful work," Mr Onuko added. The squabbling has split county employees and MCAs, turning the county offices and assembly grounds into a battlefield. The suppliers accused MCAs of awarding themselves tenders. He served in former president Daniel Moi's cabinet. BBI secretariat cleaned up the 5.2 million signatures that endorsed the Bill, and weeded out 800,000 that had entry irregularities. This comes days after he collapsed at a hotel in Nairobi and was placed under intensive care at Nairobi Hospital.
