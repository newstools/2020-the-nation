The farmer has five sugar apple, 13 atemoya, eight soursop (graviola) , 14 custard apple and five jackfruit trees.He sourced the seedlings from Kenya Agricultural Research and Livestock Organisation, Embu, with each going at between Sh200 and Sh300 each.Soursop fruits, according to him, have several nutritional benefits that include keeping cancer at bay, improving eye health, relieving arthritis and help in maintaining good health of liver and kidney.He intends to add many rarer fruits like Kiwano, Durian and Mangosteen on his farm to provide different tastes, nutrients and varieties to the local market. Patrick Gichunge is passionate about growing fruits, but he does not farm the common types that you are likely to find at every dinner table.
On his family’s two acres in Mitunguu, Meru County, he grows atemoya – a hybrid of sugar apple and custard apple, soursop and jack fruits.
“I ventured into fruit farming and trade some 10 years ago, investing Sh5,000, after searching for a job in vain,” says the 34-year-old, who studied commerce at Kenyatta University and graduated in 2010.

Among his favourite fruits is soursop. “It’s native to the tropical regions of America and Caribbean, and has anti-cancer properties,” says Gichunge.
“I developed interest in these fruits due to their medicinal properties after an encounter with a nutritionist when my father was in hospital suffering from prostate cancer. He was advised to use some of them,” recalls the father of one.

Lack of ready market

One can also extract seeds from the fruits for planting. The seeds are extracted from the pulp, washed and kept for 30 days to six months before being planted. It takes 3-5 years before the first yields are harvested.
After planting with organic manure, the crop should be mulched to conserve moisture in the soil. “Cover the plant with soil and put a 3-inch mulch.
Keep soil moist, but not wet, when the weather is hot, and when weather is cool, reduce watering,” advises the farmer, who also grows bananas farm.
Soursop fruits, according to him, have several nutritional benefits that include keeping cancer at bay, improving eye health, relieving arthritis and help in maintaining good health of liver and kidney.

“These fruits are also stress-relievers, boost immunity and respiratory system,” says Gichunge, adding they also have a delicious flavour .
Pests such as moths at the larval stage, bugs and diseases like anthracnose and root rot, are some of the challenges one has to overcome. Lack of a ready market is another.
Available market and climate
“I market the fruits in online marketplaces. I am a part-time farmer and a fruits sourcing agent for a number of exporters, who sell to Middle East. I mainly deal with bananas, apple mangoes, Fuerte, Hass avocados and jumbo avocados and purple passion fruits,” says the farmer.
He intends to add many rarer fruits like Kiwano, Durian and Mangosteen on his farm to provide different tastes, nutrients and varieties to the local market.
Gichunge sells a kilo of soursop fruits at Sh200 mainly at City Park and Ngara markets in Nairobi.
Carol Mutua, a specialist from the Department of Crops, Horticulture and Soils, Egerton University, says a farmer should decide on the fruits to grow depending on available market and climate.





“Also consider security of the fruit trees,  drainage of the farm, cost or capital and the returns on the investment and market for the fruits, whether local or export,” she says.

In order to curb insects that attack the fruits, the expert advises that biological methods can be used, which include use of fungal pathogens like Metarhizium spp.
