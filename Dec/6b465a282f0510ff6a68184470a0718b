Zimbabwe's preparations for the upcoming 2021 African Nations Championship (Chan) football tournament in Cameroon are in limbo after nine players tested positive for Covid-19.

"In adherence to our Covid-19 medical protocols, all players and members of the technical team were tested on 28 December upon their return from the festive break and the nine were found positive," Zifa said in a statement.
"The players have been advised to inform their families and contacts."
Zifa said it had suspended training for the whole team.
The latest development is a blow to Zimbabweâ€™s preparations for the tournament that begins in Cameroon on January 16.





Zimbabwe has already cancelled proposed preparatory matches with Kenya and Congo due to Covid-19 related travel complications.
"The coronavirus pandemic has made travelling hectic," said Wellington Mupandare, the national team manager.
"There was also Rwanda, who came up with a proposal, but this too was not feasible because of the travel difficulties in travelling and huge financial costs that were required."
Coaches have been complaining that Zimbabwe's players lack match fitness because they have been inactive since the Covid-19 outbreak began in March.
Chan is exclusively for locally based players.
Zimbabwe were placed in Group A alongside hosts Cameron, Burkina Faso and Mali in the group stage of the Chan tournament.
The Warriors will feature in the opening match against the hosts on January 16.
