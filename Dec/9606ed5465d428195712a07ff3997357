Area residents asked to avoid swimming in the lake, especially in areas where hippos have been spotted. Two weeks ago a marauding hippo attacked and injured an assistant chief in the area. Kenya Wildlife Service rangers and police officers from Usenge have launched a search for a rogue hippopotamus that attacked at killed two boys on Wednesday afternoon.
According to the Bondo Deputy County Commissioner, Mr Paul Wanyonyi, the two boys were swimming in Lake Victoria when they were attacked by the animal at Siungu beach.

The attack comes barely two weeks after a marauding hippo attacked and injured Migwena East sub location assistant chief Mr Alfred Oyola. 
The hippopotamus that seriously injured the assistant chief was however tracked down and killed by KWS rangers near Nyamira Girls High School. 
On Wednesday, Wanyonyi said the government is considering having a KWS camp established in the area which is prone to human-wildlife conflict.
“We are considering establishing a permanent camp within Usigu division to enable the rangers to respond promptly to distress calls from the residents,” the county administrator said. 





KWS have a camp in Siaya town which is miles away from the lake. 
Residents of Usigu and Nyang’oma division and parts of Rarieda sub-county have been complaining about attacks by hippos and crocodiles for a long time. 
Apart from posing danger to the locals, the hippos also destroy crops along the lake shores. 
Mr Eric Ochieng, who is the secretary of Siungi Beach where the Wednesday attack was reported, blamed KWS of being slow in responding whenever an attack is reported. 
Attacking villagers 
“Residents have to contend with hippos roaming around the villages in broad daylight and attacking the villagers and their livestock,” he said.

Mr Peter Owino Sawo, a resident of the beach, said several reports about human-wildlife conflict have been made to KWS but their pleas are often ignored. 
“It is unfortunate for the parents who have lost their promising children today. This would have been avoided if KWS had taken our complaints seriously and acted accordingly,” he said. 
He suggested that KWS should consider relocating the marauding animals to other national parks. 
“The Hippos have also disrupted fishing activities here. Fishermen are scared,” he asaid.
Another resident, Mr Joseph Ayieko, said that following the Wednesday incident they have resolved to hunt down the animals and kill them. 
“We have also resolved to disrupt county government activities in the beach, including boycotting payment of cess to protest the death of the two children," he said. 
Mr Wanyonyi however asked chiefs and their assistants to ensure that villagers are discouraged from swimming in the lake. 
“As we look for a lasting solution to the perennial human-wildlife conflict, we must discourage our people against swimming in the lake, especially in areas where these animals have been spotted," he said.  Visitors stream in for holiday season. To get out of the village, you have to cross a narrow water channel which is infested with crocodiles, hippos and snakes. The National Treasury has revised the tax bands for salaried workers.
