He said casualties included women and children.
A security source said the car bomb detonated in the west of the capital, and a health ministry official also confirmed the blast.
"It was a powerful explosion that has caused a lot of damage to houses in the vicinity," the source said.
Television footage showed at least two cars on fire, with billowing plumes of thick black smoke.
The Afghan capital has been hit by a wave of deadly violence in recent months despite the Taliban and government engaging in peace talks to end the country's long conflict.
