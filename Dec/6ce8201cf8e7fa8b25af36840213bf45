Nine months ago, the second floor of The Oval, Westlands, the home of tour company Moyo Holidays, bustled with activity as staff organised travel plans for international tourists. This frenzy of activity is still evident, except today, the office is the centre of operations of #TeamPankaj, an initiative that donates food relief to residents of Nairobi’s poorest slums.

Three months after Covid-19 broke out, Pankaj Shah was forced to shut down his tour operator business. In the second week of March, Kenya had announced the first Covid case, sending shudders across the business landscape.
A rampaging virus. Suspended international travel. Global gloom. Pankaj, 55, knew he would be out of business for many months. For the first time in 40 years, he was out of work. Few weeks later, the country went into lockdown.

He went to his bank and withdrew Sh300,000, which he spent to buy food and other essentials. He would distribute them to 300 families in a city slum. To Pankaj, this was a one-off act of generosity as he sought his next move.
Donation
But this donation would set in motion an initiative that would keep him engaged for the rest of the year. “I hadn’t seen the kind of suffering I saw among people in the slum,’’ he narrated to the Nation at his office. “Their agony broke me, but it also motivated me to intervene.” First, he appealed to his friends, who donated foodstuffs and money towards the cause. These he would deliver to low-scale neighbourhoods and children’s facilities in Nairobi.
Initially, donations came mostly from the Indian community in Nairobi and Kisumu, who he could easily reach out to. In the first week alone, Pankaj collected more than Sh600,000 worth of foodstuffs and other essentials. While he could have sent his team of 25 employees home for lack of business, Pankaj retained them to help facilitate the initiative.

For thousands of slum dwellers in Nairobi and across the country, the lockdown was a devastating blow. Many of them lived off menial jobs such as washing clothes for middle-class families. With people staying at home, these jobs dried up, sinking their livelihoods.
Unspeakable suffering followed in Huruma, Githogoro, Kayole, Shauri Moyo, Mathare, Lucky Summer, Mwihoko and tens of other slums. Meanwhile, Pankaj continued to appeal for donations, opening a floodgate of aid from Kenyans from all walks of life. Banks, supermarkets, businesspeople and friends contributed money and food parcels as the initiative quickly gained steam.
Bakeries donated breads, wholesalers gave sugar, rice, cooking oil, maize and wheat flour by the tonnes while other well-wishers donated biscuits, cereals, children’s toys and sanitary products.
Money donations
As hundreds of tonnes of food donations came in, Pankaj suddenly found himself in need of logistical facilities. Shiv Temple in Westlands would offer its entire basement as a storage facility, where consignments have been received and dispatched to various destinations in Nairobi since April.





“Many Kenyans wanted to donate food but couldn’t because of restricted movement during the lockdown. They, however, supported us with money donations,’’ he said, noting that Kenyans demonstrated the spirit of Harambee (coming together) by helping in whatever way they could.

Nine months later, a multi-million shilling fund, hundreds of donors on board and hundreds of truckloads of food donations, Pankaj believes Covid-19 paved the way to his purpose in life.
His compassion, Pankaj said, was nurtured in 1988, after a brief interaction with Saint Mother Teresa during her visit in Kenya. Pankaj would later spend 100 days in Calcutta, India, volunteering at the home of the late Catholic nun.
When the Nation visited TeamPankaj offices, it had the air of a call centre. More than 10 assistants were busy making and answering phone calls from donors, community groups and leaders. Others were busy planning deliveries and doing clerical work, supervised by Pankaj.
This festive season, Pankaj is running a funds drive to collect money to buy food packages and other Christmas gifts for more than 15,000 families with autistic children and those with cerebral palsy.
Donations can be sent through M-Pesa till number 5074087 (Name: Serengeti). Buhari on Saturday urged security forces to arrest the gunmen. Rivalries in the ruling Jubilee Party play out in the Senate. Man wanted his mother to sell family land and give him the money. Their homes fell prey to Al-Shabaab gunmen swearing allegiance to the Islamic State group. They are seeking clearance with various regulatory agencies as the race to replace the late Justus Murunga intensifies.
