Solar PV technologies can be adapted to customer needs.Solar-powered mini-grids have and continue to be installed in remote islands in Lake Victoria and in the arid and semi-arid areas. The ongoing conversation on the viability of solar technologies for energy access in Kenya is missing one thing; the voice of the ordinary energy consumer, especially the poor and under-served communities that remain in the dark.
 Access to reliable and affordable energy is pivotal to the achievement of the Big 4 Agenda.

Limited or no access to affordable and appropriate energy solutions significantly compromises the attainment of the Big 4 Agenda, including food and nutrition, security, manufacturing, affordable housing and healthcare.
The government, however, has made great strides towards achieving its energy access goals through the Kenya National Electrification Strategy, which aims to achieve universal electricity service to all households and businesses by 2022.
 Energy access rates stand at 75 per cent, with the recognition of the key role played by off-grid options, particularly mini-grids and stand-alone solar systems that complement grid extension and intensification.

});
}, 62000);
}



Even with this milestone achieved, we should not lose sight of the communities that still lack access to modern energy services and rely on dirty fuels such as kerosene lamps for lighting. Communities in the counties of West Pokot, Turkana, Marsabit, Samburu, Isiolo, Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Tana River, Lamu, Kilifi, Kwale, Taita-Taveta and Narok, which contribute to 20 per cent of the population, largely remain unserved.
It’s a fact that grid access to last-mile areas continues to be a costly exercise. This lack of energy leaves people with fewer economic, educational and social opportunities as well as poor healthcare, the latter being a critical need, especially in these Covid times. To curb this, decentralised renewable energy technologies, notably solar photovoltaic (PV) technology presents a strong case for enabling access to clean renewable and cost effective energy.

Solar-powered mini-grids
Solar PV technologies can be adapted to customer needs. They range from pico solar systems that are typically used to provide indoor lighting and mobile charging, to larger and more sophisticated, solar home systems capable of providing energy to power radios, TVs and even fridges. Solar technology is also associated with mini-grid solutions targeted towards remote regions, a sign of substantial demand for energy to power larger equipment.
Solar-powered mini-grids have and continue to be installed in remote islands in Lake Victoria and in the arid and semi-arid areas. They are changing people’s lives, providing utility to numerous households, businesses, and institutions.
The solar sector is one of the strongest in the region with business models and technology innovations such as pay as you go (PayGo), affording low-income earning customers the opportunity to acquire the technology while paying for the energy service in manageable instalments. Solar-powered mini-grid systems are more cost-efficient and environment-friendly than diesel powered generators that were once popularly used for the same service.

});
}, 62000);
}



Government initiatives such as the Kenya Off-grid Solar Access Project that targets to electrify 1.3 million households lends credibility to the merit of solar energy.

Meeting the needs of the poorest people will remain both a challenge and a noble objective, calling for multiple service options, business models and payment options.
This is the surest way of ensuring that the ongoing energy access conversation is in the same language as Wanjiku’s. The Uganda Communications Commission says the channels were used to mobilise riots in November that resulted in many deaths. Residents report seeing SNA troops taking strategic positions along the border. Kenyan Uber drivers say their investments have gone down the drain.
