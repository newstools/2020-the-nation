The rightful winners of the event as below, and appropriate steps are being taken to ensure each one gets their rightful and deserved prize, and well done to the winners."Hence, the corrected version put Krish Beiju as the overall winner with 37 differential points, while Ebill Omolo became the men winner with 38 points. He won ahead of Raju Mangat on 46 points (75-29), while Dennis Musau was third on 48. The Ladies title went to Mercy Nyanchama on 46 points. Justice was finally served for youngster Krish Beiju, one of the leading junior golfers at Vet Lab Sports Club, thanks to the quick intervention of club captain Adam Nyaga and his golf committee.
Beiju, a handicap five golfer, had posted gross 77 for nett 72 in the first round of the 2020 Vice Chairman’s Putter golf tournament, before posting 35 points in the second round, which gave him a differential of 37 points.

Beiju, however, was awarded the junior title instead of the overall winner’s prize which went to Ebill Omolo, who had posted nett 71 and 33 points for a differential of 38 points.
However, following a complain to the captain by the Junior Golf Foundation (JGF), captain Nyaga and his golf committee met and decided to correct the error.
In a short statement, Nyaga said “by way of this notice, the Captain and the Golf Committee of Vet Lab Sports Club would like to correct an inadvertent error that occurred during the awarding of prizes at the Chairman’s Putter event on December 5, 2020.
