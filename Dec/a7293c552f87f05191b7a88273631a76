Lusweti, who had been serving his second term as MP, was rushed to the hospital after developing breathing problems.
The 64-year-old is survived by three widows and 12 children.
Deputy president William Ruto is expected to attend the burial alongside several lawmakers.
Wetang'ula's eulogy
At a memorial service on Friday, Ford-Kenya leader and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula said Lusweti was committed to bettering the lives of Kabuchai residents.
Speaking during a memorial service, Mr Wetang'ula said the party has been dealt a big blow by his death.





The senator noted that Lusweti was once rated the best MP in terms of use of the County Development Fund and exemplary performance in the education sector. 
"Mukwe was one of my closest friends as I grew up with him. He rose from a Kanu youth winger to chairman of the Bungoma Municipality, before joining politics, due to his humility and honesty," he said.
Leaders' promises
Among the leaders who attended the service  on Friday were Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi, Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa, Bungoma Woman Rep Catherine Wambilianga and several MCAs from Western region.
The Kiminini MP said that as Ford-Kenya's secretary, he will ensure the party wins the seat in the by-election set for next year.

"Our ANC brothers will not field a candidate here while we will not field one in Matungu," he said.
Ms Wambilianga said they will not allow Lusweti's funeral to be turned into a political battle ground.
She further asked residents to adhere to the Health ministry's guidelines for preventing the spread of Covid-19.
Mr Waluke said he is now the acting MP Kabuchai Constituency, which was split from his Sirisia Constituency.
He promised a fitting send-off for Lusweti.
