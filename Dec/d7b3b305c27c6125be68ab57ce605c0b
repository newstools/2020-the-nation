A local government administrator and another junior commander of Danab forces also died in the attack that left several other soldiers and civilians were wounded.

“I strongly condemn the abominable act of terror that targeted our brave soldiers and innocent civilians in Galkayo today,” Roble said of the attack on Friday night.
“Our heroes gave their lives protecting our citizens. I pray for the martyrs, and condole their families. Terror and its evil has no place in our country,” the PM said.
The attack may have been Al-Shabaab’s statement against the government whose installations it routinely attacks in Somalia. But it also came as factions of Al-Shabaab allied with ISIS openly declared war on Al-Shabaab affiliated with al-Qaeda terror group.
Somalia is this month expected to hold parliamentary elections but the threat of Shabaab and frequent attacks have added to the challenge of ensuring a smooth vote.
The UN in Somalia also condemned the attack and called for those responsible to be brought to justice.
