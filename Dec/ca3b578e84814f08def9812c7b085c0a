Zablon Kerima: Detection of new strains an indicator of good science
To say that the Covid-19 pandemic has subjected humanity to untold suffering is an understatement.
Being a novel virus, scientists from diverse backgrounds pulled out all the stops to understand its biology, a process that unravelled vital information about the virus, enabling scientists to embark on efforts to develop safe and effective vaccines.

There appears to be light at the end of the tunnel, following the approval of several vaccines.
However, the revelation that new strains of coronavirus are circulating in the UK, South Africa and Nigeria could complicate efforts aimed at controlling the deadly virus.
According to WHO and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), these strains are highly transmissible and could be prevalent in many countries. Admittedly, identification of these variants in real time is a testament to a remarkable contribution of modern science.





 It paves the way for investigation of the variants with an aim to understand their biological characteristics that distinguish them from the original strain.
It would also allow for further work to determine if these variants bring about severity of the disease and changes in antibody response or vaccine efficacy.
Foreign environments
That the original coronavirus has mutated to more transmissible variants is not a surprise to scientists who study viruses. Coronaviruses fall under the RNA type. RNA viruses have shorter generation time due to extremely high replication levels, which operates in an environment that is prone to errors. This, inevitably, results in high mutation rates that are linked with increased evolvability and virulence.

These traits equip viruses with the ability to adapt to foreign environments in other organisms, including humans, where they cause transmissible infections. As a result, RNA viruses have been implicated in the most devastating pandemics, including two of the worst — Spanish flu (1918-1920) and Aids (1981- to the present).
Recent applications of new technology in biology have led to the development of high-throughput sequencing tools that can accurately determine the order of molecules that make up genome of viruses and other living organisms, at an unprecedented speed.
These tools have improved the understanding of biology at a genomic level, allowing changes, including, but not limited to, mutations to be identified.
Employing these tools, scientists were able to sequence and analyse the complete genome of the novel coronavirus a few months after it was reported, unearthing key features that facilitated vaccine development.
