Knut national seat
The membership of the once giant union has dropped to 32,000 in just two years. Teachers say his combative style has upset TSC bosses and the Ministry of Education.
For a person to win a Kuppet or Knut national seat, he or she is required to have won top seats at branch level.
Hopefuls for top union positions will declare their interest after winning at branch level.
The unions elect their national leaders for a five-year term. With no term limits, they can be re-elected as many times as possible.
The Kuppet national executive is working together to ensure it goes to the polls as a united front.
Mr Misori told the Nation that the elections would begin on January 15 at branch level and end on February 27 while Mr Sossion announced that Knut’s would be held from January 4 to March 31, 2021.

Branch secretaries and other officials have gone without pay for months. Some office property has been auctioned.
