Shirao now hopes that no one will surpass his eight goals tally to deny him a third straight golden boot in the tournament which is in its fifth edition.





Gogo Boys confident
Gogo Boys coach Wilbur Chisira is confident of carrying the day.
“After the semi-finals, we had a meeting with the players and agreed that it is our time to shine. Our journey has been a tough one, but we have fought our best. In the final we are meeting Ping a team that is as experienced,” said Chisira.
His Ping counterpart Bill Okumu said he will be banking on the vast experience on his side to have the final laugh when curtains fall on the tournament.
"I am handling a more experienced team although they treat me with utmost respect. Most have played in the top flight and second tier leagues. Their experience is already a plus to my team and I am going to use it against Gogo Boys who are young and inexperienced,” said Okumu.

He added: “I know their top scorer (Shirao) is down due to an injury but in case he comes in, I know how to handle him because I have done it before. Yes he is a good player but I have good defenders.”
