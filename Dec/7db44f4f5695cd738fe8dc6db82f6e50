Kenya has entered into a memorandum of understanding and signed a contract with Kurume City in Japan’s Fukuoka Prefecture (province), for Kenya’s international pre-games camp.
“The meeting is expected, therefore, to discuss the schedule of the teams and requisite preparations including planning for Covid-19 compliance in Japan,” a statement from NOC-K said.
“The budget will also be tabled and discussed in the meeting.
“The principal funding of the Olympic Games is expected to be covered by Government, therefore it is the opportune time for the budget to be discussed and understood by the Government officials to facilitate the timely approval and release of funds.
“Part of the glitches reported from previous games is late approval of budgets which hamper the operations,” the statement added.
“From the athletes’ perspective, it is mentally challenging for them, having prepared for the Games for four years, and still facing a lot of uncertainty, including the challenges they are facing with training,” said Tergat.
“We should, therefore, work on giving the athletes the best preparations we possibly can. They need physical, psychological and material support to get them in a competitive level.
