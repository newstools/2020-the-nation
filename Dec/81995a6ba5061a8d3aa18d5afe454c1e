Omollo on his part clarified that overseeing K’Ogalo's future Caf matches depends on the agreement between the two clubs.“I don’t have a problem being available for the upcoming continental matches again, but that will be possible depending on an agreement between the two clubs. I have a contract with Rangers and I have fully resumed my duties,” said Omollo. Posta Rangers chairman John Tanui says the team's tactician Sammy 'Pamzo' Omollo will not available to oversee Gor Mahia's Caf Champions League first round ties against CR Belouizdad of Algeria.
The 49-year-old guided Gor Mahia to their 4-3 aggregate win against APR of Rwanda in the preliminary round.

However, he has since resumed his coaching duties with Posta Rangers and even led the team's training sessions on Tuesday at Jamhuri showground in Nairobi.
“Our coach has resumed his duties fully at the club as we prepare for our next game against Wazito in the league. We had an agreement with Gor that they benefit from his services only in the two matches against APR and not any other this season,” said Tonui.
He ruled out any more agreements with Gor concerning the experienced tactician saying Rangers need his services to get good results and challenge for the league title this season.





“We will not aloow him to assist Gor Mahia and I am even sure K’Ogalo also have plans of getting a qualified coach for the continental matches. We are not denying them a coach in bad faith, but we also have to look at our situation in the league.
If he can win matches with Gor, he can also do the same at Posta Rangers,” added Tonui. The official also ruled out releasing Omollo to coach K’Ogalo on a full time basis saying he has a contract with the club.
Gor play away to the reigning Algerian champions on December 22 in the first leg, before hosting the return leg on January 5.
Brazilian coach Roberto Oliveira still can’t oversee the team’s continental matches because he lacks Caf ‘A’ coaching license or Uefa Pro certificate.
