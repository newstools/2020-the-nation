“I have prepared well for the last two months despite Covid-19 challenges. I have worked on my conditioning and speed that is now top notch,” said Okolla in an interview at his training base at Penthouse Gymnasium, View Parks Towers, Nairobi.
“I want my boss to know that his officer is taking the war to DRC and wants the right ammunition and blessing from him ahead of the bout,” said Okolla, the reigning national heavyweight champion.

“I am the only professional boxer in Kenya Police Service and I will be glad if I am to get full support from my service and the Ministry of Sports,” urged Okolla, who has a record of 12 wins, four losses and no draw (12-4-0).
Okolla’s opponent, Mulowayi, 33, who has eight wins, two losses and a draw, fought last on December 21, last year in Germany where he lost to Polish Pawel Sowik in a non-title contest.
Okolla’s last outing was the Commonwealth elimination bout against former World Boxing Organization (WBO) Africa heavyweight champion Ebenezer Tetteh of Ghana on August 10 last year in Accra, Ghana where he also lost.
“I really learnt a lot from the loss but it’s all about preparations that come along with sponsorship that we sadly lack,” said Okolla, a father of two- Spinks, 15 and Floyd, 12.

Okolla thanked Pent House Gymnasium Regina Mutuku for allowing him to train at her modern facility for free for the last two months. “This is really inspiring and it has saved me a lot,” said Okolla, who hails from a boxing family.
Okolla’s father Alfayo, an employee of Kenya Railway, is also a former national middleweight champion while his elder brother Daniel Shisia, who is now a coach with Kenya Prisons Service, is a former national super heavyweight champion.
Okolla, who turned professional in 2010, has been the national heavyweight champion since knocking out James Nyariki on September 26, 2015.

One of the two coaches training Okolla, Francis Olando said his boxer is ready to make 'Big Jack' small come the title fight.
“We have worked on three key areas that have improved tremendously- his footwork, punching strength and stamina,” said Olando adding that Okolla's speed and combinations can only get better ahead of the fight.
Olando hinted that they have formulated the right anecdote for Mulowayi, having watched and gone through several video clips of his past fights. “All is well and Okolla is ready to rumble in Kinshasa,” said Olando. “Boxers are suffering and are eager to go back to the ring.” Pulev said he had been waiting for his moment to fight Joshua after he was denied a world title shot in 2017.
