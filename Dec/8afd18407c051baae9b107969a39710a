Two reformed robbery convicts infamous for crime in the 1960s to the mid-80s say they had a ruthlessly enforced code that barred gang members from using brutal force against women, the elderly and children. 

John Kiriamiti, who wrote My Life in Crime, alongside his fellow gang member George Githenji revealed that whenever any of the members broke that rule, he would be shot dead.

In the world of crime, Kiriamiti was known as Jack Zollo, whereas Githenji was GG, and together, they confess, they stole millions of shillings. 

“It was simply unacceptable to, especially defile, rape or use unnecessary brutal force against our victims. It was not like today’s gangs that shoot people indiscriminately, sexually assault and use all other forms of brutal force against victims,” Kiriamiti told the Nation.

Reserved for police

Real gangsters reserved raw violence for their direct opposite competitors — the police, he said. 

“However, in all instances that we engaged the police in violence, we always suffered more damage than we could mete out,” he said, adding “you do not engage in force and win.” 

“During our times, gangs operated in a distinct way where they exercised self-censorship in enforcing their dos and don’ts.” 

Githenji, who together with Kiriamiti robbed banks, petrol stations and wealthy families in Nairobi, Nakuru and Mombasa counties, said: “We were organised thieves whose agenda was to make money but not terrorise the society. In fact, it was frowned upon for any gang member to rob the common mwananchi. We only targeted companies and the obscenely rich.” 

“We knew that such targets insured their cash and even if we robbed them, their covers would in the long run compensate them.”

googletag.cmd.push(function () {

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {

});
}, 62000);
}




He lamented that “today thugs act as if in competition to not only impoverish, but also maim and murder even the very old and the very young.” 

Adhered to tradition 

Kiriamiti said the gangs of old used to adhere to tradition, which forbade women, children and the elderly going to war. 

“The only brutal force we used to execute in our robberies was to point guns at people, fire into the roofs and ceilings to make it crystal clear that what we had were not toys and order our victims to lie down with faces pressed on the ground.” 

Substance abuse 

Githenji blames the brutality in today’s gangs to substance abuse. 

“We took our criminal occupations like any other job … We respected what we did and we retained a touch of humanity for our victims. We had an imagination that those we robbed, if given a chance to escape our ordeals with minimum trauma they would go back to making more money for our future hits,” he said. 

Kiriamiti added: “We never went about robbing while high on drugs or on alcohol, rather, we would plan while sober, revisit our plans while sober too and strike while under no influence.” 

Alcohol was only imbibed after a successful heist.

});
}, 62000);
}




However, Kiriamiti cautioned: “It is written in all religions that those who thrive on others’ sweat remain cursed and will never prosper.”

}
