Users around the world also reported problems with Google Drive, the Android Play Store, Maps, and Docs.
The tech ggiant's search engine, however, remained unaffected.
Google indicated the outage had affected all of its services for the "majority" of users.
“We’re aware of a problem with Gmail affecting a majority of users,” a status update on a Google dashboard said, followed by another message that said service has been restored for some users.
“We expect a resolution for all users in the near future.”
