Few challenges have tested Kenyans’ collective resolve, resilience and resourcefulness in modern times than the Covid-19 pandemic. Families, teachers and education policymakers are unlikely to have a normal Christmas this year as they burn daylights and midnight oil, trying to figure out how to navigate school re-entry early after nearly a year of coronavirus disruption.

However, Kenyans have manifested their customary determination not to turn over and die, but to confront emerging challenges with unyielding resolve.
Parents, school managers and policymakers are grappling with various options possible to kick-start the school calendar, but in compliance with the Ministry of Health protocols.
No one wishes to have school re-opening turn into super-spreader events like political rallies, parties and weddings. Specifically, social distancing requirements for schools have thrust the education sector into uncharted territory requiring a raft of infrastructural demands, including, but not limited to emergency construction of extra classrooms, dormitory spaces and recruitment of additional teachers to man the extra classes.

Sanitation facilities
This is in addition to a plethora of sanitation facilities like extra water supply and storage facilities, expanded common facilities like dining halls and accompanying infrastructure. The school re-entry emergency to-do list includes replacement — on temporary or permanent basis — of thousands of elderly teachers and those with underlying health conditions, who have since been exempted from teaching duties over extra risks they face under the Covid menace. It is a fact that even during normal times, shortage of teachers was still a problem.

Extra ordinary times call for extra ordinary resourcefulness, actions and decisions. Thankfully, the hard actions demanded by the unique circumstances of the moment come during the era of devolution, when priority setting, decision-making and resource utilisation has since been devolved to various action centres at the devolved units.
With the enormous resources and functions that have since been devolved to action stations on the sub-national levels of government, there exists considerable leadership capacity, resources and institutional assets to bring to bear to the emergency health requirement to set up extra facilities to enable school-entry. 
These include the National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF). Leadership and institutions at the local level should be mobilised to play a role and offload the burden of emergency response from school managers.
Non-state actors involved in education delivery, including faith-based institutions, philanthropists and development partners should offer a helping hand on how to deliver extra physical facilities and human resources in an emergency situation visited on the public education sector by the covid-19 pandemic.
Procurement procedures

Among ideas worth considering is how county governments, elected leaders (CDF management and legislative enablement on issues like by-passing normal procurement procedures), schools could create and combine synergies with other institutions like technical training institutions (Tvets and polytechnics), the military, the National Youth Service (NYS) to quickly deliver the physical facilities needed and at minimal cost.

Once political consultations and clarity on the role of each participant is secured, the delivery of the extra class rooms and dormitory facilities should take a shorter period and cost less than through normal disbursements of resources to schools, tendering processes, disputes that come with public procurement etc.
Polytechnics and technical schools have tendered for and executed public civil construction works in the past and have capacity for quick determination of Bills of Quantities , and human skills sets for quick execution if the military and NYS supplied materials at minimal non-commercial cost.
The national government has already taken a lead in this direction by setting aside resources for mass production of desks in response to the social distancing requirements ahead of reopening of schools.

It is already apparent even if the desks construction was delivered on time, not all schools have the extra class rooms required to accommodate the extra desks and learners.
In anticipation that the Covid menace won’t last forever, local stakeholders can determine construction materials most appropriate for the extra spaces needed and in a timely manner to meet reopening needs. In a few weeks’ time, anxiety is likely to hit fever pitch unless parents are assured of concerns of safety of learners.
