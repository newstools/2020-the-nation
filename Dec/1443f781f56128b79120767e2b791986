From the respective ends of the political spectrum, they are an insult to the honorific.Out of their unbridled mouths come toxic words and utterances that are not just rude and primitive, but ultimately divide the people and incite hatred and violence. Social media junkies have in the past few days catapulted two video clips of a pair of Kenyan politicians on best behaviour to the top of the trending charts.
Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa and ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna going hammer and tongs at each other in absolutely unbridled fashion clearly excited many Kenyans, who enthusiastically shared and ‘liked’ the videos on WhatsApps and other digital chats platforms.

});
}, 62000);
}



The cheers and ululations heard as the clips were viewed and spread clearly replicated the reactions of those who watched ‘live’ the great performances Ms Jumwa and Mr Sifuna at separate campaign events for the Msambweni Parliamentary by-election.
Ms Jumwa, a renegade ODM MP, is part of the brigade campaigning for Independent candidate Feisal Bader, who enjoys the patronage of Deputy President William Ruto. Mr Sifuna, on the other hand, was stumping for the ODM flagbearer Omar Boga, who is being backed not just by the party leader Raila Odinga, but also by President Uhuru Kenyatta.

});
}, 62000);
}



The language employed in that toxic exchange cannot be reproduced in a decent newspaper. Ms Jumwa is an Honourable Member of Parliament. Mr Sifuna is an aspiring Honourable after putting in a decent performance in the race for Nairobi Senator at the 2017 General Election.
Political animal
From the respective ends of the political spectrum, they are an insult to the honorific. However, they are only acting in the best tradition of the Kenyan political animal, in which regard their platform histrionics can be considered stellar.
You could see from the video clips that their respective crowds were appreciative of the charged vulgarity. They cheered and egged them on and no doubt welcomed them back to their seats with hearty high-fives and fist bumps.

});
}, 62000);
}



One did not see signs of disapproval or embarrassment on the respective stages, and neither on the social media platforms where the two clips swiftly went viral.
Viral is the word. In this day and age, it describes a picture, video, graphic or other piece of information circulated rapidly and widely from one internet user to another.
The original term describes something caused by or relating to a virus. That should be the operative term in this context. Emergence of Covid-19 makes us all acutely aware of what a virus is, how fast it spreads, and the death and destruction it can visit upon civilisation.
Our political leaders in their element visit on us verbal pandemics. Out of their unbridled mouths come toxic words and utterances that are not just rude and primitive, but ultimately divide the people and incite hatred and violence.
Now, this is not just about Ms Jumwa and Mr Sifuna, at best excitable chatterboxes who are mere cogs in the wheel.
It is also not just about the Msambweni Parliamentary seat. This is a by-election that would ordinarily pass unnoticed on the national news radar but for the fact that it provides the stage for a titanic battle between the Uhuru-Raila forces and the Ruto brigade.

}



Msambweni represents early skirmishes on the supremacy battle around the impending Building Bridges Initiative referendum championed by President Kenyatta and ODM leader Odinga against the ‘No’ forces grouped around Deputy President Ruto.





Barking dogs
And that in itself is just one staging ground ahead of the 2022 General Election where President Kenyatta seems to be assembling a vast effort to block the prospects of his estranged deputy succeeding him in State House.
We can thus presume that in all the verbal garbage, Ms Jumwa, Mr Sifuna and others of their ilk are nothing more than mere mouthpieces at the respective service of Ruto or the Uhuru-Raila duo.
The real principals own the barking dogs, and as long as they are not calling them to heel, own their words as well as any consequences that may arise, including hatred, suspicion and political violence.
Now, before turning our fury on the principal leaders, we must look inward at ourselves. We own them. We are responsible for elevating Mr Kenyatta, Mr Odinga, Mr Ruto and other national leaders to the lofty perches they occupy.
They did not get up there by stealth, subterfuge or violent capture, but by our own free will in abuse of the sacred right to vote.

We get the leaders we deserve. That applies to the aforementioned fellows at the apex, footsoldiers such as Sifuna and Jumwa, and fellow dishonourables the likes of Mike Sonko, Kimani Ngunjuri, Oscar Sudi, Milly Odhiambo, Sospeter Ojaamong and Purity Ngiricha, et cetera.
They are us and we are them. Whatever they say or do reflects who we are. Uganda, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan have been experiencing internal conflicts. Real gangsters reserved raw violence for their direct opposite competitors — the police, he says. US president-elect praises voters for casting ballots in record numbers on November 3.
