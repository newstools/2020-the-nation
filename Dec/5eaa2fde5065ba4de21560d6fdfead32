The officer, in the company of his colleagues, is said to have assaulted Bramuel Chakunza last Saturday for violating the dusk-to-dawn curfew.
Mr Chakunza succumbed to injuries on Tuesday morning while receiving treatment at Nyanchwa Adventist Hospital.

The Directorate of Public Prosecutions later directed that Maubi, 36, be arrested and charged for murder.
The suspect will now return to the dock on January 7 for plea taking.

He was brought to court under tight security on Thursday morning and arraigned before Kisii Resident Magistrate Dorcas Mac Andere but did not take plea.
The prosecution requested that the accused be detained for a week to allow him undergo mental assessment.
“The accused will be detained at Kisii Central Police Station for seven days and mental assement test done at Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital,” said the magistrate.
Repair shop
The victim, a resident of Vihiga County, had been operating a phone repair shop in Central Kisii town and had only joined a friend who had gone to check on his wife who was in the cells when he was bundled into the cells where he was clobbered ruthlessly, police said.
The police officer was picked in a public identification parade.

});
}, 62000);
}



Officers from the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU) and those from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) conducted the parade, where the public identified the constable.
Chakunza’s death led to protests in Kisii town where hundreds of young men and women staging demos to demand justice. During the march, they wore red T-shirts inscribed with the words “stop killing the youth”.
A post-mortem revealed that the deceased died from stomach injuries inflicted by a blunt object that caused internal bleeding. The report further indicated that there was accumulation of blood in the parts of his body that were hit.
Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i said a report on the incident would be out in the shortest time possible.
The ministry, he added, will implement the recommendations of a team comprising the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa) and the police's Internal Affairs Unit. Mr Chakunza succumbed to the injuries on Tuesday morning while receiving treatment in hospital. Interior CS Fred Matiang’i promises to release a report on the incident in three days. In his new year’s message to the country, the President called for a renewal of minds in the New Year 2021. He paraded the newly elected Msambweni MP Feisal Bader as the “firstborn” of the so called Hustler's Movement. Ever since Abiy Ahmed came to power, the Tigray regional government has been at odds with the central government.
