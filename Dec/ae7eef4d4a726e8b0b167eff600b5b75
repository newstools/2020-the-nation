Later in the morning, she went back to the house to get her son. 

“They left together. I was not worried because she has been doing that for long,” Ms Achieng’s sister Beatrice Odundo said, adding that she routinely goes to Mombasa on business. 






About 10 minutes after the two left, Ms Odundo received a call from a number she had never seen. It was her nephew on the line. 

“The boy informed me that they had been involved in an accident in Kibarani and that his mother was in the sea,” she said. 

“I received a second call informing me that my sister was dead.” 

Ms Achieng, 33, was dead on arrival at Coast General Hospital.

Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho condoled with Ms Achieng’s family, terming the incident “harrowing”. 

He urged motorists and other travellers to be cautious while on the road, especially during this festive season. 

“It is painful to lose a loved one in this manner. I humbly urge road users to follow traffic rules and exercise extreme caution while driving,” Governor Joho said. 

On September 29, last year, Ms Mariam Kighenda and her four-year-old daughter Amanda Mutheu died in a similar accident at Likoni channel.
