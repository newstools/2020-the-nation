We turned to e-commerce to keep businesses humming.Globally, the latest wave of cyberattacks has targeted companies making lifesaving Covid-19 vaccines. In these sunset days of the year 2020, we look back at how technology shaped the contours of our lives. Understandably, Covid-19 dominated our day-to-day and online discussions.
When I typed ‘Covid-19’ on Google Search, in one second, I got more that 6.6 trillion results.
One of the first grave sign that the Covid-19 was hell-bent at upending our lives was the stoppage of international travel that immediately crippled trade and tourism.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {

});
}, 62000);
}



Then, all large gatherings, whether in offices, places of worship or schools, closed. Few people went to hospitals unless they had to.
Shaken by the firestorm of Covid-19, tech wizards went into a spin trying to figure out how technology could become our saving grace. We turned to e-commerce to keep businesses humming.
Nifty tech tools made it easier for people to do business locally and internationally and pay by credit cards or mobile money services.





Meetings went virtual, hosted by digital communication tools. Although Zoom is the preeminent tool in the family of online communication platforms, Skype, Facebook, Google Hangouts and Teams also became the go-to platforms.
Whereas the searchlight of science has guided scientists in finding vaccines to break the back of the virus, many companies will forever conduct business using these tech tools either entirely or partially.
Stronger foothold
2020 will also go down as the year when cryptocurrencies —especially Bitcoin— gained a stronger foothold worldwide, not only among individual investors, but also big banks and businesses.
Consequently, the price of Bitcoin shot up more than two-fold. Many analysts now hold an optimistic prediction of cryptocurrencies. In the same vein, blockchain-based businesses— the technology on which cryptocurrencies operate — have also continued to grow, surpassing expectations.

Social media lived up to its billing, both as the bane and the boon of spreading information. The agents of disinformation capitalised on the speed and spread of internet and its attendant tools to frustrate health organisations' efforts to share correct messages about Covid-19.
This effort was complicated by some users with the most magnetic social media following, including the US President Donald Trump.
Talking of Trump, Twitter reverted to flagging his daily torrent of tweets. Fact-checkers found his theories about the US presidential elections that took place last November baseless. He lost the election to his challenger, Joe Biden. President Trump filed tens of lawsuits, none of which salvaged his loss.
As technology continues to flourish, cybersecurity is a big headscratcher. Hackers work tirelessly to outwit digital technology users and wizards alike.
Globally, the latest wave of cyberattacks has targeted companies making lifesaving Covid-19 vaccines. They are intent on stealing vital vaccine information, possibly crippling the vaccine making science.
At the individual level, we often use mobile phones and computers in environments that are least protected against cyberattacks.

});

}



The resultant security lapses embolden hackers to break in, infiltrate and inflict maximum harm. Happy holidays!
