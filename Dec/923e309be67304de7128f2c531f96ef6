Public transport parks are always overcrowded, especially by matatus.Peak hours present even more danger of infection as vehicles move slowly due to traffic congestion. For the first time in centuries, humanity is fighting a common enemy – coronavirus disease. In Kenya, rural counties are bearing the brunt of what has been termed “the second wave of the pandemic”.
Even though Nairobi and Mombasa counties are still leading in infection rates, the disease is ravaging the rest of the nation. No doubt, the pandemic has disrupted our daily activities, ruined economies and livelihoods.

While the increasing infection rate has been blamed on various factors, public transport has played a significant role.
Transport operators are well placed to prevent the spread of the infection. Urban public vehicles and long-distance travel, including trucks, should remain active participants in enforcing set Covid-19 prevention protocols.
Public transport parks are always overcrowded, especially by matatus. Peak hours present even more danger of infection as vehicles move slowly due to traffic congestion. Already in Nairobi, streets are heavily congested again.





A 2019 study on city traffic revealed that 42 per cent of Nairobians walk to work, 48 per cent use matatus, 5 per cent commute by private cars, while the remaining 5 per cent use other modes.
The research further estimated that during morning peak hours, the average vehicular speed is about 8.3 km/hour and 7.6 km/hour during the evening rush hour.
This shows that commuters in congested matatus and buses may be easily exposed to the risk of infection.
Public service operators 
At the onset of the pandemic, the Ministry of Transport adopted a raft of measures and issued directives aimed at reducing the spread of Covid-19 through public service vehicles. It directed that all buses and matatus and equipment therein be cleaned, disinfected and sanitised after every trip.

});
}, 62000);
}



Besides, all public service operators were directed to provide sanitisers for use by passengers before boarding. All operators were directed to wear masks and not to allow any passenger to board a vehicle without wearing one.
They were also required to observe social distancing between passengers by carrying only 60 per cent of the capacity of their vehicles.
Whether the directives are being adhered to or not is anybody’s guess. The appeal today is to public transport operators to adhere strictly to the containment measures. 
The new surge in infections call to action for everyone to work together. Fred Rogers, the entertainer, told us long ago that in times of disaster, “look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping”.
That sentiment is a source of comfort and an important reminder that we are not alone. From courageous healthcare workers on the frontlines to essential employees in the service sector. 
The appeal today is to public transport operators to adhere strictly to the containment measures.
If we do this effectively, it may be possible to win the battle against this deadly virus. Let us all apply a little more discipline.
