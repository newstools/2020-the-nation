The blood-thirsty gang is said to target watchmen, slashing them to death before breaking into business premises and stealing goods.Residents of Kakrao location in Suna East Sub-county and Awendo town have borne the brunt of the attacks. Police in Migori have pledged to crack down on a group of criminals known as “the 24 Brothers”,  and who are said to be operating with impunity. 

The blood-thirsty gang is said to target watchmen, slashing them to death before breaking into business premises and stealing goods. 

In the latest attack, two watchmen were brutally murdered during a robbery incident in Migori town on Saturday night. So feared is the gang that locals only speak about them in hushed tones, fearing reprisals from the criminals who are often armed with machetes, metal bars and other crude weapons.

Residents of Kakrao location in Suna East Sub-county and Awendo town have borne the brunt of the attacks. They said the gangs comprise youths, who launch attacks during the dusk-to-dawn curfew, breaking into shops and killing their victims before taking off with the loot.

And, with the festive season inching closer, residents are apprehensive that the attacks will become more frequent. County Commissioner Boaz Cherutich, who recently held a crisis meeting to deliberate on the security concerns, said that the gang’s time is up. He said police patrols have been boosted and that the officers are coordinating with local administrators. 

Heightened patrols 

“Our officers are on high alert and have heightened patrols in the affected areas. We also call on residents to report these criminals since they live among us. Civilians should not be held hostage by gangs yet we have adequate security teams to protect lives and property,” he said. 

The watchmen who were attacked were guarding a hardware and a wholesale shop in Kakrao on the outskirts of Migori town. They were slashed with machetes and beaten with clubs before the gang broke into the premises and stole goods worth Sh600,000. 

Mr Moses Ouma, the owner of the hardware shop, said the guard had attempted to ward off the attack but he was overpowered and brutally murdered.

});
}, 62000);
}




 “He attempted to raise the alarm but was overpowered by the thugs who beat him senseless and left him for dead before breaking into the hardware,” said Mr Ouma. Residents found his body in a pool of blood on Sunday morning with deep cuts. 

“Most of the gang members are young men who are well known and we have even raised concerns with the local administration but they seem reluctant to crack down on these criminals,” said Mr Fred Andala, a trader at Kakrao shopping centre. 

Robberies 

He added: “We fear that our lives will be at stake if drastic measures are not put in place to flush out the gang and bring this madness to a stop.” A section of residents blamed the rising insecurity on the lack of street lights. They claimed Kenya Power disconnected the lights due to unpaid bills. 

 “We never used to witness burglaries and robberies when there were street lights along the highway but the gangs have taken advantage of the darkness to unleash terror on us,” said Mrs Jane Bokello. 






In Awendo town, a similar raid at a petrol station on Sunday left one watchman dead. The gang stole gas cylinders. 

Residents said the gang operates in groups, with some breaking into business premises as others keep watch. Mr Phillip Okumu, a victim of the gang, wondered how they managed to break into his shop, a short distance from the police station.

});
}, 62000);
}




“It is ironic that we are falling victims of burglary just meters from the police station yet police are patrolling the streets during curfew,” said Mr Okumu. 

Surge in crime 

In September, residents of Oruba estate in Migori town and those in Masara town in Suna West Sub-county complained of a surge in crime, with the same gang blamed for the attacks. 

Armed thugs broke into a local church in Masara and made away with the public address system and assorted electronic goods. Private homes, hotels and other business premises have not been spared either. 

“Both the police and local leaders are to blame for the complacency because the incidents occur when civilians are indoors. With the curfew, locals entrust their property with law enforcers yet they seem to be doing little,” said Mr Ben Migori, a resident of Suna West. 

Mr Ken Odongo, a resident of Oruba, called on the police to enhance patrols and arrest the culprits: “It is unfortunate that police do not want civilians to roam about at night yet our property is insecure. We are helpless. It’s high time our leaders looked into the issue.”
