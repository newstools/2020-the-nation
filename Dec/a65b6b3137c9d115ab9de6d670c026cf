Most Kenyans are hardwired to equate Christmas with consumerism: from drinking alcohol to shopping to partying, you name it.Relatives, too, often feel entitled to money and goodies from their kin. This year’s norm-shattering Christmas will be the ultimate antidote for the hedonism that accompanies the holiday each time. Most Kenyans are hardwired to equate Christmas with consumerism: from drinking alcohol to shopping to partying, you name it.
Retailers have always cashed in on the "Christmas Spirit" over the years, and overzealous but unscrupulous preachers have taken advantage of the season, shouting themselves hoarse from the pulpit, repeating the phrase: “It’s the season for giving!” until their pockets fill up.

Children expect new clothes, shoes, toys and a lot of (unhealthy) food. Relatives, too, often feel entitled to money and goodies from their kin.
"Send me Christmas," they will say when they call under the guise of checking up on you. Black Tax is usually paid in advance. Nobody expects anyone to be a Christmas grinch.

Given such trends, the definition of the "Christmas Spirit" definitely depends on whom you ask. But let's go back to the basics for a bit.
Humility and modesty
Christmas is a celebration of the birth of Jesus. When Jesus was born, his mother Mary placed him in a manger “because there was no place for them in the inn". It doesn't take a doctorate in theology to retrieve the lesson on humility and modesty here. And why the excessive celebrations people indulge in during the Christmas season is a contrast to some of the values Jesus espoused.
Amid a worsening Covid-19 pandemic, some Kenyans are travelling to their villages to celebrate Christmas with their loved ones, treating the holiday as they have always had: a chance to imbibe drinks and eat copious amounts of food.
Only that this time, they might also be bringing Covid-19 along with them. We can only pray that they will wear their masks, sanitise and keep their social distance. And that they will be future case studies on how all that can be achieved while eating, drinking and making merry.

For those who will choose the "Stay Home, Save Lives” mantra during this Christmas season, they will surely be doing the Lord’s work.
Many perks
There are many perks that they will reap from not celebrating Christmas the "normal way".
First, weight loss will not appear in their New Year resolutions because they won't have any weight to lose from unhealthy eating. Their livers and kidneys will go on holiday, knowing that there will be no excessive alcohol or sodas to keep them busy. Their bank accounts will smile, too, safe in the knowledge that there will be no unnecessary spending.
May this Christmas in a pandemic serve as a wake-up call to remember the pre-ordained purpose of the holiday, which was to celebrate the birth of Christ. And may we remember that a celebration can be achieved minus the thrills, frills and reckless spending. Amen.
