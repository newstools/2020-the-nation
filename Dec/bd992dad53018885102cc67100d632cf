“My closest neighbours and friends are birds and animals. The way they interact with me is different from the way they relate with visitors. They have a unique way of communicating,” Mr Kemboi says.

Wildlife conservation 

He adds that he has already obtained an operating licence from the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and the Uasin Gishu County Government to make his venture legal. 

“My aim is to preserve endangered species, make it educational and empowerment centre where Kenyans can appreciate the importance of conservation of wildlife,” said Mr Kemboi.

The park is often visited by primary school pupils as well as secondary school and university students. 

“We usually acquire the food, including vegetables and cereals, locally as we want to make the habitat as natural as possible. We, however, have to buy specialised diets like fish and fruits. I have four volunteers, including a veterinary officer, to take care of the animals’ health needs,” he explains.

Mr Kemboi says he developed an interest in animal conservation as he toured parts of South America. 

“We are seeking partners to realise our dream of conserving rare wildlife which is part of our national heritage for future generations. Nobody should view wildlife as an enemy.”
