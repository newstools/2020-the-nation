Youth feel overly criticised and ‘hang out to dry’ as critique after critique.Parents call it disrespect; youth term it a “phase of life” and boredom. Statements as hawa watoto wametushinda indicate a sharp wedge drawing blood from the lifeline of our youth, by parents and guardians.
Youth feel overly criticised and ‘hang out to dry’ as critique after critique is made over a recent scenario where young people were smoked out of a sex den. Parents call it disrespect; youth term it a “phase of life” and boredom. Glaring disconnect is an understatement as both sides await exoneration.

Ironically, courts are full of young and old alike, caught in misdemeanours. The adage “old is gold” won’t rid the white elephant in the room. Adolescents and teens often say: “No one listens to us!” to perhaps affirm the African belief: “Children are to be seen, not heard”.
Are grown-ups guilty as charged of misconstruction to resolving the youth dilemma and perhaps considered fellow-felons? A shrill emerges, “Open not Pandora’s box; can of worms and let sleeping dogs lie”, preferring to lend a deaf ear to the youth dilemma.

In their defence, the accused render themselves innocent until proven guilty. 
Article 6 of Unicef’s Convention on the Rights of the Child states that a child has a right to develop to “maximum extent possible”, and “States Parties recognise the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development” (Article 27).
Thus, ignorance feigned over ratified policies is no excuse in levitation of offspring birthed into harsh realties. Youth will only be plunged into further confusion, if no roundtables, anchored on goodwill, unravel mysterious sagas such as orgies, which desensitise youth consciousness.

Presence, not presents, is what leads them to reckless behaviour.
Sense of responsibility
Caregivers affect children, propagate a culture of house-managers raising their youth as norm, fostering parental obscurity and hands-on effect, to mar duties required of youth and sense of responsibility.
A recent study shows: Using the internet for as little as three hours a week increases levels of depression and reduces ‘social support’ (defined as perception that someone is being cared for). If that’s not insane, I don’t know what is!
A note to parents with youth ranging 10-25 years: Social media is raising this digital generation. While reality that children won’t get everything right is comforting, rhetoric remains: Gadgets are here to stay.
Telecommunication gurus, oblivious to fatal dual, caregiving debase role with hitherto referencing side effects to users, continue to expand online empires. This must be addressed. 
Insults hurled at youth to unscramble thorny matters lead to further disengagement for the aggrieved party. Unfortunately, settling scores through violent acts on elderly parents exposes levels of anger, frustration and self-esteem, which grown-ups term “rot in society”.
A study involving content analysis of 142 frequently visited Class of 2008 MySpace profiles found that most 16-17-year-olds displayed health risk behaviours pertaining to substance use, sexual behaviours and violence.

Grown-ups must own up to call the battle by its rightful name: Pandemic in child rearing.
Nelson Mandela once said: “Fools multiply when wise men are silent.” It urgently behoves all concerned authorities to let our judicious actions speak louder than our words. The Treasury CS last week announced that temporary Covid-19 tax reliefs will expire at the end of the year. Speaker gives IEBC leeway to prepare for and conduct a by-election following the death of MP Justus Murunga. Protesting learners said the student was attacked on Saturday morning while taking a bath just before the morning preps.
