True leadership is percolative and touches every individual, not just the mercantile class.It is obsessed with equality of opportunity so that every Kenyan child gets a fair share. I want to explain to you, from my perspective, why we remain poor, even though our environment has great potential and what we need to do to change our fortunes.
In my village, there is a teacher and community leader called Bob Mwirigi. Older people know him as Mwirigi wa Ciokibise. I have to warn you that there is dense cultural, tribal and linguistic complexity in that last name. Like raw honey, it is viscous, sticky, almost impenetrable. My people speak five mutually intelligible dialect clusters: Tharaka, Chuka, Mwimbi, Imenti and Igembe/Tigania, roughly corresponding to the sub-tribes of the Meru.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



But within the main dialects are fascinating and numerous distinctions, fragments of influences and interferences. Picking through these ancient sounds and wondering about their origins and evolution is, I think, like eating a prime piece of boiled goat back, picking out choice morsels from between spine disks.

The “S” in some parts of Imenti Central is not the sibilant described by modern linguistics; it is a more primieval and exotic affair which might give me a PhD one day, Inshallah, if some snot-nosed kid has not beaten me to it. But I digress.
Some 50 years ago, Bob, now a retired TTC lecturer and teacher, and other educated members of the community formed an organisation to promote education in the village and held an annual prize-giving day, awarding top pupils and schools. It’s active, though my participation has been shamefully poor. It provided a loose network of support for young people. 
Without that network and Bob, I probably would never have become a journalist. First, Bob had more books that any other person in the sub-location in an age when books were the main source of knowledge.
Secondly, he was deeply interested in young people and helping them to build their careers. So, when I wanted to apply to the School of Journalism at the University of Nairobi, I, naturally went to see Bob. I can’t remember whether he got me something to read but he put me in touch with Dr Gerrishon Ikiara, a leader of that association and then a senior lecturer at the Department of Economics.

I came to Nairobi to see Dr Ikiara, who had arranged for me to see yet another lecturer who had taught the course at the school and could answer the question I had carried for 250km: How does one become a journalist in Kenya?
I found Dr Ikiara a very smart man. From a communications perspective, he was like Lenin, with an accent. Big brain, very verbal. The genius of Lenin (and I am speaking from old memory) was his ability to explain Marxism to peasants, reducing complex philosophy into morsels that they could eat.
True leadership 
I was also struck by Ikiara’s access to new information, to fresh data from research which made his scholarship current. I met other economists, I think Dr Manundu and a brilliant one who became a Sunday Nation columnist and an arrogant public intellectual who nowadays does not recognise me when we meet in the mall. Which is fine, let me tell you Maina, because I don’t recognise him also.

});
}, 62000);
}



I stayed in touch with Dr Ikiara, who continued to write for the papers where I worked. In 2004, he summoned me to his office at the Ministry of Transport, where he was the Permanent Secretary. He was livid. I was managing editor of the Standard and a columnist for the Sunday Standard. He is an avuncular guy, very thoughtful, kind and polite but on this occasion he was firing from barrels I did not know he had.

He said I was reducing journalism to a “debating club” which risked formenting revolution and turning the country into “a Bosnia”, which sounded all the more effective when he rendered it in our accent as “a mbosnia”. Being a fiery young man with ideas of my own who knew a couple of societies which could have benefitted from a revolution, I was unmoved.
But when he was done dressing me down and we sat down to have discussion, he taught me lessons that have been with me all these years. Then, the Narc government was quite fanatical about mid-level colleges. Admission was devolved to districts and each was given a quota with a massive attempt at ensuring that admission was fair.
“When a child is admitted to a college and becomes a teacher or a nurse, he or she changes the fortunes not just of the individual but the whole family and community,” I recall him telling me. 
During the Moi state, admission to these colleges was part of the largesse dispensed by the corrupt patronage system.
Here is my point: We need true, passionate leadership to change the lives of our people. True leadership is an accelerator of potential, not just a writer of constitutions.
Humble Bob has helped to transform the lives of hundreds of young people; the Constitution writers have only transformed their own lives and those of their relatives.

True leadership is percolative and touches every individual, not just the mercantile class. It is obsessed with equality of opportunity so that every Kenyan child gets a fair share. It is durable and laser-focused on the needs of our people and not the creation of jobs for looters.

That is the X-factor in our progress and an important lesson on this day of 2021.
Happy New Year. Republicans are notorious for rigging elections by suppressing the vote. Our survival depends on us, so does our welfare. In his new year’s message to the country, the President called for a renewal of minds in the New Year 2021. He paraded the newly elected Msambweni MP Feisal Bader as the “firstborn” of the so called Hustler's Movement. Ever since Abiy Ahmed came to power, the Tigray regional government has been at odds with the central government.
