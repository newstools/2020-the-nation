A group of Nairobi MCAs have exuded confidence that they have a watertight case against Governor Mike Sonko and they will prove the same before the Senate.
Minority Leader and mover of the impeachment motion, Michael Ogada, said they are fully prepared to face senators with evidence to show why Sonko must go home.

“We are ready to face the Senate to prosecute our case and show why we sent Sonko home. We have evidence and we are confident that they will uphold our resolution,” said Mr Ogada.
Majority Leader Abdi Guyo echoed Mr Ogada’s sentiments, saying they have assembled a legal team led by lawyer Ndegwa Njiru to prosecute their case before the Senate.
“We are fully prepared and good to go to present our evidence before the Senate. We are 100 per cent sure that the Senate will agree with us and save Nairobi residents from an inefficient and incapable governor,” said Mr Guyo.





The Matopeni MCA, however, took issue with some senators, including Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina, accusing him of prosecuting Governor Sonko’s case in the court of public opinion. He asked him to allow them to present their evidence before the Senate.
Censure motion
He said there was no court order stopping the assembly from debating Mr Sonko’s censure motion, rubbishing claims from Senator Ole Kina that they defied the court.
“I want to make it very clear that there was no court order stopping us from proceeding to impeach the Governor. If we did disobey any court order then let us be cited for contempt,” he said.
Mr Guyo said they will prove how the voting was conducted to finally put to rest claims by pro-Sonko MCAs that they were impersonated and their accounts logged into.

Meanwhile, although silent since Mr Sonko’s recent woes started, President Uhuru Kenyatta could not avoid making a thinly veiled attack on the City Hall boss, praising Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) for changing the face of the capital city in just over eight months in charge.
“Huyu mnamuita super governor sijui kama ni matusi lakini muangalie nini imefanyika Nairobi. (This person you refer to as super governor, which I’m not sure if it's an insult, but check the development he has brought to Nairobi since he took over),” said President Kenyatta as he enumerated achievements by NMS under Director-General Mohammed Badi.
When Mr Sonko was facing impeachment in February, the President intervened and called for a meeting with all the MCAs at State House.
This time, however, he has not shown any interest in saving the embattled governor.
