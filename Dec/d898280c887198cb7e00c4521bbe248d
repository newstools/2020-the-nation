On Saturday, the Kenyan international put Kashiwa ahead in the 14th minute after winning an aerial battle against defender Yamane to slot home into an empty net after side-stepping goalkeeper Jung Song-ryo.

🟡⚫️ GOOOOOAAAALLL! He's done it again! A superb effort and composed finish from @OgadaOlunga! Michael Olunga puts @REYSOL_Official ahead against the 2020 MEIJI YASUDA J1 LEAGUE champions early on with his 28th goal of the campaign! 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪© J.LEAGUE - All Rights Reserved pic.twitter.com/tSEH4U6AOC— J.LEAGUE Official EN (@J_League_En) December 19, 2020 
He had gone down in the fourth minute after colliding with Song-ryo in Kawasaki box. Kashiwa had anxious moments as the 26-year-old stayed down for a few minutes to receive treatment before returning to play in the eighth minute.





More chances fell to Cristiano, Ataru Esaka and Olunga as well as opposition’s Leandro Damiao cleared by Ominami and goalkeeper Kim Seung-gyu before half time.
Yusuke Segawa doubled Kashiwa’s lead with the first move of the second half. However, when Kashiwa thought victory was in sight, Kawasaki reduced the lead through Akihiro Ienaga on 48 minutes. A blunder by Seung-gyu saw Kawasaki equalise through Damiao in the 55th minute before a sucker punch from Ienaga, who had also scored twice when these two sides met in the first leg when Kashiwa fell 3-2 away.  
Odds were stacked against Kashiwa as they went into the match without a win against Kawasaki in four matches after losing the last two away fixtures with an aggregate score of 6-1.
Brazilian coach Nelsinho made three changes from the team that hit Sanfrecce Hiroshima 1-0 in midweek, replacing Takahashi, Kamada and Kureya with Yamashita, Kitazume and Cristiano. Kawasaki rung six changes to the team that floored Urawa Red Diamonds 3-1, bringing on Yamamura, Tanaka, Saito, Damiao and Hasegawa for Taniguchi, Nakamura, Wakisaka, Patric, Kobayashi and Mitoma.

For Olunga, there was no replicating his season-ending heroics of 2019 when he scored eight goals in 13-1 win over Kyoto Sanga.
However, for the second consecutive season ‘The Engineer’ finished the season as Kashiwa’s highest scorer and this time went on to win the Golden Boot with 28 goals.
His closest rival, Brazilian Everaldo, scored 18 goals. Kashiwa ended the season in seventh place with 52 points. The goal took his tally to 27 this season. He has scored 26 of Kashiwa’s 57 goals in the 18-team league this season. ODM leader claims IEBC is inflating referendum budget, but Chebukati says he is guided by facts.
