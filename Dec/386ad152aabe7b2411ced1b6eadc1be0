Four people died on Saturday in an accident along the Kericho-Nakuru highway involving two vehicles.
The road accident occurred at Ringa near Kedowa trading centre in Kipkelion East, Kericho County at around midday.
"A Toyota probox vehicle headed to Kericho town collided head-on with a Nissan Xtrail travelling towards Nakuru leading to the fatalities,” said Mr Silas Gichunge, the Kericho County Police Commander.

Mr Gichunge said bodies of the victims were taken to Kericho County Referral Hospital for preservation before a postmortem is conducted and subsequent release to the relatives.
Police are yet to confirm the number of passengers who were in the Toyota Probox vehicle and the exact number of the injured who were taken to various private hospitals in Kericho town by good Samaritans.

According to the police, the victims were all in the probox vehicle while the occupants of the Nissan Xtrail are said to have escaped without injuries.
"I am calling on motor vehicle owners to be careful while on the road. Passengers should also report motorists who break traffic rules by speeding and overloading,” said Mr Gichunge on phone.
The mangled wreckage of the two vehicles were later towed to Londiani Police Station.
The accident caused a traffic gridlock in the area but the scene was later cleared by traffic police officers.
