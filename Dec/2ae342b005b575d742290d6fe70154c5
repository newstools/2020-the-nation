Universities admit people of all classes and walks of life.They also create wealth, mostly through tax incomes, and are thus seen as motors of economic development. Our universities need adequate reforms to make them stay afloat. They play an important role in the pursuant of socio-economic development and democratic agenda for any country.
They have been central in addressing inequality by opening doors to previously marginalised and under-represented groups of society, including women, children and older persons access higher education.

Universities admit people of all classes and walks of life. They also create wealth, mostly through tax incomes, and are thus seen as motors of economic development.
The challenge has been the fact that investment in universities takes a while to realise returns. This is where there is need for public reforms and leadership to make these entities play their rightful role in development. 
Deregulation of fees
Public sector reforms, which have been recommended for a long time, should have a bearing on higher education as well.

This should lead to performance-based funding, or budgeting to create an environment of quasi-markets. This will address the inherent lack of competition and competitiveness in Kenyan universities.
This is done by introducing paradigm shifts in our institutions, such that funding is based on a formula driven by directives, which are tied to inputs, outputs and performance indicators.
Suggested financing solutions include the introduction of deregulation of fees to reflect the per capita cost of education to the extent possible as the students move up the ladder, education loans, human capital contracts that work by students committing a part of their future income for financing their education, income contingent loans, graduate taxes and educational vouchers.

Finally, is the need for self-financing market determined courses. This will make it possible to get financing outside the ambit of the exchequer and introduction of public private partnerships.
