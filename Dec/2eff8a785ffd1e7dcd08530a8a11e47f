Their schoolmates attended the funeral in large numbers.
The children drowned sequentially in a flooded quarry as they tried to rescue each other.
Chief Zack Munari said the second child drowned as he tried to rescue his younger brother and that their elder sister drowned while attempting to save them both.
Activities suspended
Mr Munari asked authorities to rehabilitate the quarry to prevent similar incidents.
The administration has ordered the suspension of activities at the quarry with immediate effect.





All the speakers at the funeral said the minors had a bright future.
Mukinyai headmistress Mary Njoroge said the siblings were hardworking.
"We have lost children who were committed and dedicated to their work, both in school and at home. We shall miss them," she said and urged parents to keenly monitor their children while they are at home.
The county government, through Chief Officer Ann Njenga, said the area needs fencing to prevent such incidents.
Nakuru Woman Representative Liza Chelule urged the community that benefits from the quarry to meet stakeholders and come up with a solution.
She also asked the school to erect a fence around the quarry to protect children.
