It takes teachers from the rural depths so much time to fumble and fill out and submit the Tpad online to their employer.Those that do not fill out and submit this thing are faced with many threats, including warning letters or withholding of their salaries. Anyone who has ‘sampled’ police cells will admit that they all smell the same. There is a municipal smell in all stations and how that comes to be we cannot tell. It is the same with teachers, especially those based in rural areas. They somehow look the same and cannot hide the profession from the people around them.

A group of teachers walking together in a township near their school can never hide. They are recognised instinctively. How they are pointed out requires some research but we do not know nor can we hazard a guess as to why they stand out.
There were times when they would be seen with jerry cans during payday; they would line up at a bank and after that they would buy paraffin, meat and other supplies before getting into a bar to refresh themselves with cold beer. It was a custom and everybody knew teachers have been paid. In fact, the payday was some sort of a day off from school. It really was a waste.

That trend went out of vogue and new pay methods have come up and made the teachers somewhat invisible but still recognisable. These days, it is customary to see unhappy teachers in a group in town seeking a cybercafé where they would crowd together. This happens thrice every year and we just found out that their employer demands that they fill in Tpad every term.
Some may ask what Tpad is: Well, it is the acronym for Teacher Performance Appraisal and Development. The thing speaks for itself and it is a harmless document that seeks to quantify things that can never be quantified. It takes teachers from the rural depths so much time to fumble and fill out and submit the Tpad online to their employer.

Professional growth
This thing was just copied from other jobs that have clear and quantifiable targets and foisted upon the educators in a copy paste style. The main rationale for its introduction was to appraise teachers’ competence and gauge their desirability for the duty they have undertaken. Its motto is: ‘Enhances Professional Growth and Learning Outcomes’. How it does that remains to be seen.
Those that do not fill out and submit this thing are faced with many threats, including warning letters or withholding of their salaries. We wonder just how the 300,000 people who submit their forms are individually assessed by the commission but it is a time of legacies and everyone would wish to leave a legacy.
We confess lack of knowledge on what a legacy is; but the word is in fashion and the TSC commissioners would like to be praised to their graves for having brought Tpad.
This simple thing that can be done in a few minutes in town is a headache in the marginalised areas. The Tpad day has become like the payday of yore with teachers taking turns to travel to the nearest centre to fill out the form that seems more important than their job.
This is the new heartache and it too shall come to pass. Those that are rooting for it shall go with it or else employ thousands of people just to classify the individual Tpad of every teacher. It will not stay long.
