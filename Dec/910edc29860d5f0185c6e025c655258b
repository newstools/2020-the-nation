Mr Boga came second after garnering 10,444 votes.
He pledged to work with Mr Bader to transform the constituency and tackle various challenges.
"I take this opportunity to congratulate MP-elect Bader for winning the Msambweni by-election and I wish him the very best as he takes over the duty to serve the people of Msambweni," he said.
"We may have insulted each other during the campaigns … let us leave that behind and focus on the future because politics is not hatred," he added.





Mr Boga urged Kwale residents at large to work together to revive the economy that has been hard hit by Covid-19.
He thanked ODM party leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta for supporting him in his quest to win the seat.
"I want to sincerely thank my party leader and all other ODM leaders, supporters who took their time to support my candidature during the past three months as well as President Uhuru," he said.
On his part, Mr Bader extended an olive branch to his competitors to work together for the sake of Msambweni residents.
While delivering his acceptance speech at Dr Babla Secondary School tallying centre shortly after being declared the winner, Mr Bader promised to diligently carry out his duties as Msambweni MP.

"I want to thank the people of Msambweni for believing in me. I want to thank all the people who walked with me through to victory. We will work with our opponents for the sake of our constituency," he said.
He also thanked DP Ruto for supporting him. 
He promised to give priority to education and health in his first 100 days in office. Bader garners 15,251 votes in a hotly contested by-election.
