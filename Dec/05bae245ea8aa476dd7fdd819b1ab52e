If you have tried all the commercially available products (such as pyrethrines derivatives and amitraz), I would recommend that you request your veterinarian to use injectable preparations (like Ivermectin) that are active against both external and internal parasites.
You can complement this with tick control measures such as rotational grazing, bush clearance and biological methods.

****My 200 rabbits died all at once
I saw your write-up on death caused by contaminated maize. What can cause the death of over 200 rabbits, with the major symptom being jumping for a few minutes and then dropping dead. 
Adeyemi Adeniyi, Nigeria
The description you gave suggests sudden death with non-pathognomonic signs. For rabbits, sudden death can be caused by poisoning, fright/stresses (heart attack), gastro-intestinopathies or sudden change of environments.
Losing 200 rabbits at ago suggests that the group was exposed to things like contaminated feed, contagious microbial infection or sudden change of the status quo, for example, sudden too much noise, predators and releasing indoor rabbits to hot environment.

Greens/weeds harvested from the field might contain poisonous plants but usually, commercial feeds are safe only when all the requirements on storage and transportation/application are adhered to.
To know the cause of the problem, I would recommend that a post-mortem is done on the carcass (or sacrifice one that looks sick) to identify the pathological lesions and affected organs as this can tell the probable cause of death.
To avoid such losses that may arise due to management malpractices, ensure you use appropriate fresh greens/commercial feeds for rabbits, maintain hygiene in the rabbit’s enclosures, proper stocking rates and seek veterinary advice on disease control measures available in your country.

Crops you can farm in Nyanza
As commercial viability of sugarcane wanes in Nyanza, I need to know what other crops can one successfully grow in the region?

Buying heifers
I need heifers, please help.
Amos Oreno
Many dairy farms sell heifers and in-calf heifers but the most important point to consider is which part of the country are you going to rear the animals.
This is important because of environmental variations like temperature that affect the heifers. Another factor is the objective of setting up the farm, that is, are you interested in milk quality or quantity.
Market survey is equally important to help you choose production based on market demand. You did not specify where you are but we can point you to selected dairy farms where you can get heifers.
Dairy management hands-on skills are also extremely important as you venture into the business.

Lime application
At what time does one apply lime. Please explain. 
Peterson
Lime is a soil amendment that helps to increase the pH, thereby reducing its acidity. First, you need to test your soil to find out the acidity level before applying the lime.
Testing the soil is also mandatory, since it will help your expert in calculating the lime requirement of your farm, since different farm soils require different amounts of lime to bring the pH to the desired level.
