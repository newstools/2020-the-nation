The party, however came with its own hiccups as eight children were reported missing at the Nyali Beach.
The beach community security leader Babu Mkajire said a number of children went missing because of the huge crowd which turned up at the beach.
“We did not expect so many people. We thought they would be afraid of coronavirus, but we are happy people have come to celebrate and business is booming here at the beach,” said Mr Mkajire who is also in charge of business at the beach.

At the Mama Ngina Waterfront, tourists could be seen enjoying coconut water (madafu) and crisps as they enjoyed the breeze near the Likoni Channel.
