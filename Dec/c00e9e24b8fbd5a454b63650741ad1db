“Furthermore, it will highlight the ‘super powers’ of Kenya’s athletes and show how sports can change lives and how iconic sports heroes are improving lives in their communities and pushing the known boundaries of athletic performance one second at a time,” said Amina.





Amina was speaking when she led Athletics Kenya (AK) in celebrating its 70th Anniversary at the Nyayo National Stadium in a ceremony that was attended by 70 legendary athletes.
“I invite the sporting fraternity to fully participate in this monumental project whose end aspiration is to create an online sports museum to share the unbounded gift of Kenya’s rich sporting history with the rest of the world,” said Amina, who led the legends in cutting a cake to commemorate the occasion.
In attendance were AK president Jack Tuwei, Kisii Senator Sam Ongeri, who is a former AK chairman, Major General Fatuma Ahmed and Governors Mutahi Kahiga (Nyeri), Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu), among others.
Amina paid glowing tribute to Kenyan athletes and AK for elevating the country’s image with solid performances globally captured through the long journey starting at the 1954 Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, Canada.

“We all recall the long road that we have travelled since Kenya’s debut at the Olympic Games in 1956 in Melbourne Australia while under colonial rule and in 1964 at the Tokyo Olympic Games as an independent Nation,” explained Amina.
“The story of athletics in our country is one that has attracted keen global scrutiny in the quest to unearth the secrets to our exceptional athleticism and winning formula.”
Amina noted that AK remains one of the most successful sports federations not only in Kenya, but in the world, having produced a galaxy of stars who have followed in the footsteps of pioneers.Achievements stand out
