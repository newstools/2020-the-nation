Matungu NG-CDF chairman Athman Wangara Khamis, the former MP’s wife Christabel Amunga and Constituency Manager Odanga Mutimba Pessa are among the aspirants from the late MP’s side who were cleared to vie as independent candidates.
Mr Bernard Wakoli, former Ford Kenya national youth leader who defected from the party to run for the seat after party leader Moses Wetang’ula announced that the party would not field a candidate in Matungu and, instead, support ANC, was also cleared to contest independently.
Other candidates armed with Independent Candidate certificates are Samuel Munyekenye, Wilberforce Chitechi Luttah, Notcus Borry Kevin and Stanslaus Kubende.
 Mr Charles Lutta Kasamani, who had warmed up to run for ANC party primaries, also went for the Independent Candidate ticket after his party handed Peter Nabulindo a direct ticket for the March 4, 2021 by-election.
Mr Noah Haji Shiunzi was cleared to contest on the Roots Party of Kenya party ticket. The party is led by Lawyer George Wajackoyah who comes from Matungu.
ODM had not nominated its candidate by December 21 as directed by the Commission.
An aspirant, Paul Posho, said they were directed to present themselves for nominations on December 24.

Mr Posho is expected to face off with former MP David Were who has announced his comeback, and businessman Paul Achayo.





“We shall celebrate Christmas with the nomination results,” said Mr Posho.
Direct nomination
A section of ANC members from Matungu criticised their party for giving a direct nomination ticket to Mr Nabulindo and threatened to ditch the party, accusing the leadership of failing to promote democracy.
Enraged by the decision, the sub-branch office-bearers, led by chairman Michael Matanji, issued a statement threatening to fight back by supporting an independent candidate.
It is not clear who they will support between Mr Wangara, Ms Amunga and Pessa who were cleared to run as independent candidates because they were all close to the late MP.
It’s also not clear whether the Jubilee party will field a candidate in the by-election despite party members allied to Deputy President William Ruto threatening to launch a tough campaign similar to the one in Msambweni for a candidate who will be endorsed by the DP.
Former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali, Didmus Barasa (Kimilili) and Malulu Injendi said they will launch a tough campaign for the candidate who will be endorsed by the DP.

Clan politics is anticipated to be critical in the by-election featuring Abashitsetse clan, which is the dominant in Matungu, against other small clans.
Mr Murunga was from the Abashitsetse clan and his clansmen are hoping to retain the seat. On the other, other clans are planning to combine forces to unseat the Abashitsetse from power.
Mr Raphael Werimo from Abakolwe clan, which comes second to Abashitsetse, claims that it is their turn to lead Matungu.
“The first MP, Joseph Wamukoya, and the latest MP Justus Murunga were from Abashitsetse and it is time the Abashitsetse stayed out and let other people take charge of Matungu,” said Mr Werimo.
Other factors expected to play out in the by-election are regional placement with arguments that the seat was in the Western part under Mr Were for 15 years and it is time for the people from the Northern part of Khalaba, Kholera and Mayoni wards.
