After a devastating year, we all hope 2021 will be one of recovery. Businesses around the world have been battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, which cast a dark cloud on economies globally.
Indeed, the 37-member Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said in its December outlook that global output will return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021 after witnessing a 4.2 per cent decline this year.

OECD projects global GDP to rise by around 4.2 per cent in 2021 and by a further 3.7 per cent in 2022, helped by Covid-19 vaccine rollouts and accommodative fiscal and monetary policies. Insurance firm Allianz is also confident about Africa’s short-term economic development and forecasts a strong rebound of global GDP by +4.4 per cent.
Besides huge ongoing monetary and fiscal impulses, the main growth driver in 2021 will be a positive “confidence shock”, triggered by the vaccination campaign, boosting consumption, investment and trade. With these optimistic outlooks, the question for business leaders is how to position their firms in order to benefit from the recovery.





 Most valuable asset
An important lesson taught by the pandemic experience is that customer-centricity is critical for businesses that will continue to make an impact in the long term.
The banking sector, for instance, was fast in making the decision that moratorium on loans was important in order to cushion customers from total collapse. Businesses have been reminded that they cannot thrive where their own clients and customers are sinking. We float or sink together.
 I’m of the view that one of the important drivers of customer-centricity is moving it from a mere by-word that sounds good when we mention it to creating what I call the customer-centricity loop.

The loop consists of taking the customer on a journey that begins with listening to their needs, frustrations and aspirations, understating their goals, resolving their problems and eventually enhancing systems by consistently refining our processes.
In the banking sector, we have to redefine our relationship with customers and especially those who have been severely impacted by Covid-19 in order to design solutions that will empower them to get back on their feet.
It’s well established that the best firms are those who understand that their customers are their most valuable asset and tailor solutions that lead to the acquisition, development and retention of happy clients.
The recovery path will be defined by those who learn how best to deliver on these aspects and to close the customer-centricity loop.
