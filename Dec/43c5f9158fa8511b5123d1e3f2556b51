Suspected Al-Shabaab militants destroyed a newly built security camp in Mandera County in an attack on Monday night.
Borehole 11 Police Camp, built through the National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF), was reduced to ashes in the 11pm incident.
Kotulo MCA Mohamed Rashid said the attackers arrived in the township on the outskirts of Elwak town riding on motorcycles.

“We have information that the attackers snatched a motorcycle from a herdsman at Falama and used it to come to Borehole 11,” Mr Rashid said, adding the attack on the camp left the nearest mosque with damages.
Police blamed
The ward representative blamed security agencies for the attack, accusing them of laxity.
“Members of the public have been sharing information on Al-Shabaab militants seen in the area but the security officers have been sitting on it,” claimed the MCA.





He urged the people to continue sharing information with security agencies regardless of the outcome.
“It is upon them to act,” he said.
Mandera County Police Commander Georgy Sedah said he would issue a full statement after investigations.
The government closed the post in 2015 following an increase in Al-Shabaab attacks on security camps in the North Eastern region.
A temporary General Service Unit camp was set up in 2018 but was closed under unclear circumstances a few months later.
Past attacks
Last year, workers at a construction site at Borehole 11 survived a shooting by four armed men who raided the site.
The group that was in the area to build a health centre fled after hearing gunshots.
At Guticha village in Mandera North, a police reservist was killed in a night ambush by people believed to be members of the terror group.
