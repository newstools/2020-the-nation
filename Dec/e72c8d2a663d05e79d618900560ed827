Before Kenya reported its first confirmed case of Covid-19 on March 12, the 2020 tennis calendar was rolling. 

The year started with the eight-team East African Tennis Championships at the Gymkhana Club in Dar es Salaam. Tanzania Tennis Federation hosted teams from Kenya, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Comoros. 

Kenya’s top female player Angela Okutoyi, 16, who is currently ranked 271 in the ITF Junior Rankings,her twin sister Roselida Asumwa and Alicia Owegi represented the country in girls’ under-16 category, with Brandon Isami, Raymond Oduor and Edmond Ogega playing in boys’ category.

Liberty Kibue, Ruinclife Ominde and Gilbert Wechuli played in boys’ under-14 category. 

Kenya wound up fourth in the championship with two points. In the boys’ under-16 category, Kenya beat both Seychelles and Eritrea 3-0, but fell 2-1 to Burundi. 

Kenya also beat Uganda 2-1 and Seychelles 3-0 in boys’ 14 and under category, but the team suffered a 3-0 defeat in the hands of Rwanda and also suffered 2-1 losses to both Burundi and hosts Tanzania. 

There was something to cheer about when Kenyan girls finished first in both girls’ under-14 and under-16 categories in the 10-day competition. The team thrashed Uganda 2-0 and Tanzania 3-0 in the final of girls’ team event to finish top with two points.

The team qualified for the Africa Junior Championships which had been scheduled to be held in Togo in June before Covid-19 struck. Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Nigeria were the teams to watch. 

In February, Kenya hosted the African qualifiers for BNP World Team Cup Africa. The women’s team comprised of Kenya wheelchair tennis team captain Jane Ndenga, Phoebe Masika and Veronica Osogo and Asiya Mohammed, while the men’s team featured Lawrence Karanja, Collins Odhiambo, Peter Munuve and Rajab Abdallah.

But Kenya's hope of featuring in the Euro/Africa Group Two tournament were shattered on March 7 after the team lost two decisive matches to Indonesia in the best of five Euro/Africa Group 2 play-off tournament at the Gelora Bung Karno Tennis Stadium in Jarkarta.

Kenya last qualified for Euro/Africa Group Two tournament in 1992 when Paul Wekesa, Asif Karim, Nobert Oduor and Eno Polo represented the country. 

Kenya has paid dearly for her absence from 2015 Davis Cup qualifiers. It is at the tournament that the International Tennis Federation (ITF) introduced new rules for promotion of teams, specifically the use of four-year track performance to rank teams in different groups. Kenya dropped to Group Three. 






Six months after cancellation of all sporting activities in Kenya including tennis, the Ministry of Sports issued guidelines for the resumption of outdoor recreational non-contact sporting activities, including athletics, lawn tennis, golf, motorsport, cricket, cycling and badminton.

Last month, the first tennis tournament was held in Kenya after almost nine months of inactivity. 

The first of an eight series tournament featuring both men and women saw some of Kenya's top senior talents turn up to compete at Nairobi Club. The tournaments ran from November 23 to December 6. 

'Better season' 

Officials are looking forward to a better season starting January. 

"Staying away from the courts has been a big disappointment for us because we had plans for an exciting year full events to expose our players to competitions, especially the juniors who doubled in number in 2019," said Tennis Kenya President James Kenani. 

"We hope to recover the time we have lost from January, and to make a statement in June during the Billy Jean King Cup (previously known as FED Cup). 

“We are also excited that we might have some of our players contest in the Australian Open but we will know the full details by end of January," he added. 

Tennis Kenya Executive Officer Nancy Nduku is optimistic that the federation will host three international events in January, including ITF East Africa Junior Circuit, 10th Nairobi International Junior Circuit and the 12th Kenya International Junior Circuit.
