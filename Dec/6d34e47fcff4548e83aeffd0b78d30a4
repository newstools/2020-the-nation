Police report
Katsina state police spokesperson, Mr Gambo Isah, said on Sunday that they foiled the kidnap attempt following distress calls.





Isah also said all the victims were rescued and 12 rustled cows found.
The official said the students were abducted while on their way back from the Maulud occasion celebrated at Unguwan Alkasim village, Dandume.
They were accosted by bandits who had already kidnapped four persons and rustled 12 cows from Danbaure village and were trying to escape into the forest.
“On receipt of the report, the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) led Operation Puff Adder, Sharan Daji and vigilante groups to the area and engaged the bandits in a fierce gun duel. The teams succeeded in dislodging the bandits, rescued all the 84 kidnapped victims and recovered all the rustled cows,” Isa said.
“Search parties are still combing the area with a view to arrest the injured bandits and/or recover bodies. An investigation is ongoing.”

The 344 school children were abducted from Government Science Secondary School in Kankara and were rescued six days later, on December 17, after negotiations between the government and the kidnappers. Gunmen attacked Government Science Secondary School at Kankara in Katsina, the home state of President Buhari. Officials say more than 300 schoolboys were released Thursday after being abducted by Boko Haram.
