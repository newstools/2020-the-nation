When the coronavirus pandemic landed on our shores 10 months ago, the Ministry of Health spelt out guidelines to protect the citizens and visitors alike. Many have religiously followed the rules, though some do not.
But there’s more to the guidelines that is neither mentioned nor taken into consideration yet they carry much weight in mitigating the spread of Covid-19, especially now that schools are being reopened next week, not forgetting that it is during the festive season.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-1");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



It is, therefore, prudent to shine the spotlight on these protocols in a bid to help learners to conduct themselves well with respect to Covid-19.
The ‘neglected’ guidelines include proper handling of used face masks during critical times like taking meals while avoiding contamination of surfaces. Lapses in this aspect are the main cause of infections.





Another is putting on a mask when required, like while speaking to another person or coughing. 
It is paramount to know when, why and how to wear and remove a mask, bearing in mind sanitisation of our hands.
Reopening of schools
As the young and older pupils and students prepare for the reopening of schools, they should also be prepared psychologically about this deadly virus and given more information on it.
The student-specific guidelines should be clarified by experts before being incorporated into the school curriculum.
With the high risk of the coronavirus and other contaminants, we ought to have dispensaries or sanatoriums with specialised attendants in schools to curb the infection and tension among learners. 
These would help in consultation, diagnosis and even drug administration should the need arise.
This would create jobs for the relevant personnel and hive an assurance on the safety of pupils.

While speaking or coughing, do not remove the masks to avoid spitting droplets on surfaces and, if one has to remove the mask, let’s guard them from infectious elements such as bacteria and viruses.
