‘K’Ogalo’ qualified for the first round after eliminating Rwandan champions APR on  4-3 aggregate after losing 2-1 in Kigali and winning 3-1 at the Nyayo National Stadium on December 5.
Omollo was in charge when the Green Army sent the Rwandan giants packing in a match played behind closed doors at Nyayo owing to Covid-19 restrictions.
He was brought on board in place of Gor’s newly appointed Brazilian coach Roberto Oliveira Gonclaves, who was hired to replace Briton Steven Polack after his resignation in October. Gonclaves, who has since left Gor, was not cleared to coach the team because his papers were not up to standard. He left the country last week to upgrade his coaching credentials. CAF last month disqualified the 60-year-old former footballer from being on K’Ogalo’s technical bench as he lacked a CAF  ‘A’ licence or its equivalent of Uefa Pro, which is the minimum requirement needed by the continental body.Contacted, Posta Rangers Chairman John Tonui said talks were still underway between his club and Gor on the coaching issue. He said that the two teams have a good relationship and have been assisting each another during the transfer window.“We are still talking on the issue of Omollo concerning the Gor Mahia continental assignment next week. We are friends, and have been buying players from them while having some on loan so it is not a hard issue,” said Tonui.  Gor assistant coach Patrick “Pato” Odhiambo, who has been in charge of the team’s training in preparation for the match, confirmed to Nation Sport that Omollo will oversee the CAF tie.“We are leaving on Sunday and Omollo will be part of the technical bench. He is available and we shall travel with him,” said Odhiambo. Gor Mahia CEO Ray Oruo said the club’s management was working on the travel logistics.“The team is leaving on Sunday (tomorrow) and right now we are working on the logistics because it will be a long journey that requires a lot of money,” he told Nation Sport.Since the Algerian air space is still closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, Oruo said the travelling party will take a direct flight to Cairo then connect another to Tunis. The team will thereafter travel by train to Algiers.“It will be a long trip and that is why we have to leave by Sunday and prepare in good time before the match kick -off,” he added.Gor have been training at Camp Toyoyo as they look forward to a good result in Algeria then finish off the job at home and hope to qualify for the moneyed group stage. At stake is Sh58 million if the team gets past the first round.
