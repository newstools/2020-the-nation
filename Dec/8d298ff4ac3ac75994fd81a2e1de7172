Mr Mwakazi joined the Kenya Prisons Service in July 1991 as a cadet chief inspector having been seconded by the Public Service Commission of Kenya.
“I never applied to join Kenya Prisons. I was seconded by the Public Service Commission. Over the years, I have served in different capacities in the field and in Headquarters where I was the spokesperson of the Kenya Prisons Service. I later served in several stations before being appointed the Regional Prisons Commander Nyanza (RPC) from 2018 to 2019 and as Personal Assistant to the Commissioner-General of Prisons before my posting to Eastern Region as Commander in December last year,” he says.

Before joining the Kenya Prisons Service, he briefly studied law as a pioneer student of the parallel degree programme at the School of Law, University of Nairobi.
His background in law would later come in handy when, in partnership with Human Rights organisation, he set up the Kenya Prisons Paralegal Project.
As an Assistant Commissioner-General of Prisons (ACGP), Mr Mwakazi could very likely be the only prisons officer in Kenya trained by all security organs over the years, starting from the National Youth Service (pre-university course), the military and police at pre-deployment and other peacekeeping courses before serving in the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo and UNDP Somalia in 2006 and 2012 respectively.

“In Congo, I served for one and a half years while in Somalia, I served for one year as a mentor trainer and expert in mission. In Puntland, I managed to oversee training of officers of the Puntland Custodial Corps as well as oversaw refurbishment and opening of a modern prison in Gardo town. I was honoured when the prison was opened by then president of Puntland state Mohamed Farole and the Danish Ambassador to Kenya and Somalia whose country funded its construction,” he says.

The father of two girls is also a human rights and counter-terrorism expert trained at the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in the United States.
“My focus is in researching and applying soft power in deterring terrorism, especially recruitment and radicalisation in prisons, with special focus on youthful offenders by training and mentoring them,” he says.

As part of his training for peacekeeping duties, he attended United Nations courses at the Legon Centre for International Studies (LECIA), University of Ghana (2003) and the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre (KAIPTC), Accra, Ghana (2002).
“I strongly believe that with this checkered experience, there are strong possibilities in serving in diplomatic posts for Kenya and the United Nations in the near future and rising within the Kenya Prisons service command structure,” he says.
As the Regional Commander for Eastern, Mr Mwakazi is in charge of 23 prisons. Nyanza prison bosses retire after working at correctional facilities for over three decades. Prison, school, dispensary and staff houses affected. He served in former president Daniel Moi's cabinet. BBI secretariat cleaned up the 5.2 million signatures that endorsed the Bill, and weeded out 800,000 that had entry irregularities. This comes days after he collapsed at a hotel in Nairobi and was placed under intensive care at Nairobi Hospital.
