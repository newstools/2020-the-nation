Two people were killed and 11 injured when the matatu they were travelling in plunged into Sondu Miriu River on Tuesday afternoon.
The public service vehicle bound for Kisumu veered off Kisii-Kisumu road at about 1pm as the driver swerved to avoid colliding head-on with a lorry.
It ended up in the river as Sondu Bridge does not have guard rails.

Kericho County Police Commander Silas Gichunge said the matatu’s driver died at the scene and a front seat passenger on the way to St Joseph’s Nyabondo Mission Hospital.
"The matatu driver tried to avoid the oncoming lorry but hit it on the side before the vehicle plunged into the river," said Mr Gichunge.
Felix Ochieng Odhiambo, who is in charge of the hospital, said the casualties taken to the hospital included children.
"Eight were admitted here while three were referred to Aga Khan Hospital in Kisumu," he said.

The three were a mother and her two children.
One of the patients was in a critical condition, having sustained a head injury.
Plans to rush the patient to the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kisumu were delayed by the nurses’ strike which has disrupted services at public facilities.
Sondu resident Rebecca Kemunto asked the government to repair the bridge.
"It is very narrow and has no guard rails. Contractors working on the road should repair it," she said.
