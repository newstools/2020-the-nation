My Kenya My Story mobile phone film competition, an initiative of Kenya Film Commission (KFC) to grow Kenya’s film industry, focuses on application of affordable technology in telling stories. Participants use the smartphone over high-end equipment.
The third edition, held in the last financial year, was themed COVID-19: Staying at Home and Social Distancing.
The theme highlighted a wide spectrum of perspectives as expressed by over 250 filmmakers from various counties who submitted their films. Additionally, many films made good use of accessories to ensure stable shots, good lighting and audio.
For the second year in a row, David Waronja scooped the top prize of Ksh200,000, this time courtesy of his film, Automedic. 
The film 2024 by Mandela Midamba emerged second, winning a cash prize of Ksh150,000, while Mmoja by Omar Hamza Hassan was third and got a cash prize of Ksh100,000.
Muzzled by Sammy Mwaura and Covid 19 by Paul Gaturu scooped Ksh25,000 each as Jury Special Mentions. Muzzled highlighted the present struggles of people with disability, whereas Covid 19 made a commendable attempt at an action film.
Besides the above five films, the remaining 15 got a token of Ksh5,000 each, from the Commission.
All the shortlisted films received various complementaries from partnering organisations, namely Multichoice Kenya Limited, CDI Gadgets, Tecno Limited and Kenya Scriptwriters Guild.
