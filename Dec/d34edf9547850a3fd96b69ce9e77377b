Benson thought he had found a way of minimising losses from lack of market for a crop that had done very well on his farm in Meru. He realised when it was ready that he had not thought about the market.
The farmer sent me an email last week when his genius backfired, generating more problems and losses.

Benson explained that he had a bumper harvest of watermelons and decided to give some to his cow, which unfortunately got sick later.
It was vomiting, according to him, and discharging water from the mouth. He wondered what could have been happening to his animal.
He asked if the watermelons could have caused the problem. “Is there any treatment I can give?” he concluded.
That was an interesting case. Watermelons are rarely fed to cattle in Kenya because they are highly in demand by humans and they are also not widely grown.





That said, they are not suitable to feed livestock because their water content – at 92 per cent – is extremely high. I have never seen a case of watermelon poisoning in ruminants. However, I remember seeing cases of pineapple and banana poisoning.
In science, we always look for precedents when faced with unfamiliar cases. I did some desk research but could not find any published material on watermelon poisoning in cattle.
I found an experimental case of the response of sheep fed watermelons for the first time. The sheep developed an illness called lactic acidosis whose severity directly depended on the quantity of watermelon consumed.
Gas and fluid accumulation
The sheep started showing signs of disease three hours after consuming the watermelons and became most ill after six hours. Signs of illness cleared within 12 to 24 hours if no more watermelons were fed.

});

The signs of illness included poor appetite, dehydration, diarrhoea, depression and enlarged abdomen. There was also an increased heart rate.
The results of the study agreed with some of the signs Benson had seen in his cow. They also corresponded to what I thought was happening to the animal. I concluded the cow was suffering from lactic acidosis caused by the consumption of a large quantity of watermelons for the first time.
Since I could not tell how much watermelon the cow had eaten, I advised Benson to stop offering anymore and call in a veterinary doctor nearest to him.
The doctor would do physical examination of the animal and decide if the cow could recover on its own or it needed treatment.
Meanwhile, if the farmer had access to magnesium hydroxide, he could buy 500g and give the cow in water while waiting for the doctor. The chemical would work to neutralise the lactic acid in the cow’s stomach.
Sheep, cattle and goats are all ruminants and have a similar sickening way of handling large intakes of sugar or sugary feeds.
Therefore, feeds with high sugar content such as watermelons and other fruits should be introduced in small quantities, below 25 percent of the daily dry matter intake.

This enables the rumen to adjust the type of micro-organisms required to break down lactic acid and prevent it from accumulating to toxic levels.
Ruminants, unlike other animals, do not vomit. What Benson had seen was escape of fluid due to the pressure exerted in the rumen by the gas and fluid accumulated in the organ. In some cases, the escaping fluid may enter the airways and cause death when it gets into the lungs.
Large amounts of water
Animals with lactic acidosis should be immediately stopped from feeding on the offending material. Water should also be withdrawn and they are put on dry grass such as hay. They should be kept in a cool shelter to minimise water loss from the body.
Moderate cases of lactic acidosis recover without treatment within 12 to 24 hours once the offending feed is withdrawn.
Such cases have some appetite for dry grass and do not show signs of dehydration such as dry muzzle and sunken eyes, extreme depression, and a progressively swelling abdomen.
Severe cases should be treated by a veterinary doctor. Antibiotics and anti-inflammatories are injected to prevent bacterial infection and minimise destruction of the rumen wall by lactic acid.
To neutralise blood acidity, a sterile solution of sodium bicarbonate should be injected into the bloodstream.

The rumen content can be removed in severe cases. This is preferably done using a tube, in a tedious process called rumen lavage.
Large amounts of water are pumped into the rumen and drained out by gravity. The process is repeated several times to dilute and drain out the lactic acid.
The rumen content can also be removed through surgery. However, in most cases, doctors avoid surgery because of its high cost and tendency for the animals to get abdominal infections.
