Deputy President William Ruto has asked Narok residents to elect Labour Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Patrick ole Ntutu their governor in 2022.
During the burial of Mr Ntutu’s mother Nalangu Enole Ntutu on Thursday, the DP said he is ready to work with the CAS in the next government.
The matriarch was also the mother of Narok Ward Representative Grace Liaram and former senator Stephen ole Ntutu.

The DP showered praises on the CAS, saying he has done a lot in unifying and developing the region.
“Now that you want Patrick to succeed Governor Samuel Tunai, we endorse that decision,” he said.
The DP urged local leaders to unite and help address problems facing Narok residents.
Mr Tunai is serving is second and final term.
Leadership handover
DP Ruto identified himself as a resident of Narok. He said that, he and Governor Tunai have agreed to hand the leadership over to the Mara side of the county and the Purko clan.





“Patrick, be prepared and careful so that the numbers do not go against you as they did in the last two elections,” the DP said.
He asked Narok residents to “watch out and know your friend”, adding that he looked for rivals like Joseph ole Musuni and Joseph Konchella and gave them State Jobs after the 2013 General Election.
“Patrick lost direction in 2017, but I held his hand and he was given this position alongside others from Narok,” he said.
Some of those eyeing the seat, like Narok West MP Gabriel ole Tongoyo, expected the DP’s blessings.
Mr Ntutu, who lost to Mr Tunai, was the Narok West MP before Mr Tongoyo succeeded him.
They two were members of former Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto’s Chama Cha Mashinani.

The governor contest will most likely attract more candidates compared to 2017 when only three appeared on the ballot paper.
Mr Tunai beat Mr Ntutu and Mr Joseph Tiampati of the Orange Democratic Movement.
Four delegations
Others expected to take a stab at the county top seat are Devolution Principal Secretary Charles Sunkuli, Narok South MP Korei ole Lemein, Senator Ledama Olekina and Woman Representative Soipan Kudate.
Only Mr Tongoyo, Mr Sunkuli, Ms Kudate and Mr Ntutu have openly made their intentions known.
In the past few weeks, the DP has intensified political activities in Narok and Kajiado counties. He has met four delegations at his official Karen residence in Nairobi.
