Senior players grace such tournaments and their sense of responsibility rubs off on the rest of the youngsters.Handas served as chairman and organiser of the tournament till his death in 2017. The current leadership has kept the founders’  vision for youth football alive.  Youth tournaments, particularly those held countrywide during December holidays, make for a thrilling spectacle.  They are a melting pot of raw talent and have given rise to some of Kenya’s best players.
To retired players, such tournaments are a perfect forum to meet and reminisce about beautiful moments in the game from years gone by.

The raw energy and talent in ragtag teams of young men and women playing in such off-season tournaments is amazing. In such tournaments, young men and women often fight their hearts out for modest prizes, and the winning team gets a cash token to be shared out by the players, and football equipment like pairs of boots and kits.

In Nairobi, off-season football tournaments like Dagoretti Super Cup (at Riruta and NCC play grounds), Koth Biro (Ziwani), Kiko Cup (Woodley grounds in Kibra) and Otty Father Cup (Jericho) provide a platform for young players to brush shoulders with Kenyan Premier League players.

The good book says in Luke 12:48 that to whom much is given, much will be required. If (and this is a big “if”) much has been given to our professional footballers, much is expected of them by way of  acting as role models for the new crop of players.
The established players grace such tournaments and more often than not, their team work, sense of responsibility, diligence  with which they execute the task at hand, and work ethic  rubs off on the rest of the youngsters. That has been the case, particularly with Koth Biro and Dagoretti Super Cup. Koth Biro football tournament,  first held in 1978, is held annually from November to January.

Other than being used to nurture talent,  it is also a major platform for addressing social and economic issues facing young people. Retired football stars often meet their peers to reminisce  during Koth Biro tournaments.
Former Kenyan international defender Charles Handas, who played for Gor Mahia, grew up playing in the tournament. After learning the ropes, he later took over as the tournament’s organiser, making it a key fixture for Kenyan Premier League players during the off-season.
Handas served as chairman and organiser of the tournament till his death in 2017. The current leadership has kept the founders’  vision for youth football alive. 
This year,  organisers face the unique challenge of staging the tournament in a Covid-19 year.
The tournament, which had reached the last 16 stage, is on hold and will continue in January. 
But Nairobi County and Starehe Constituency leaders either do not share in the vision of the founders of the tournament, or they have chosen to turn a blind eye to the condition of Ziwani grounds, which alternates from being bumpier than the moon’s surface during dry season, to a muddy pool during rainy season.

The equally popular Dagoretti Super Cup where Kenya’s all-time top scorer Dennis Oliech has been a regular participant as player and mentor, was postponed this year due to lack of sponsorship, a manifestation of adverse effects of Covid-19.

Many other off-season tournaments such as the annual Gogo Youth Sports tournament in Siaya County,  were either postponed either due to lack of funding, or lack of capacity to comply with health protocols to ensure safety of players.
When I spoke to him, Gogo Youth tournament coordinator, Nick Otieno, was a crestfallen man.
He has had to postpone the off-season tournament due to lack of a sponsor. His team also lacks capacity to organise a tournament in line with Ministry of Health protocols. But he is unbowed.
He plans a bigger and better tournament next year and for a good measure, he plans to take former Kenyan internationals Peter Dawo,  John “Bobby” Ogola and Tobias Ochola to the village that gave Kenya striker Steve Odiaga. 
The talent and energy on display in off-season tournaments make them worth the time. Young people get to showcase their talent while using their energies productively and entertaining people. And while at it, there is a token of appreciation.
Such off-season football tournaments have been a defining feature of December holidays. But the coronavirus pandemic has reduced the steady flow of such tournaments to a trickle. 
During the few tournaments that are held, organisers look anxiously behind their shoulders.
