Both pre-election and post-election violence are instigated by political kingpins.Those extra seats are supposedly meant to appease these warlords, lest they incite citizens to violence. It is not in doubt that the extra political seats proposed in the Building Bridges Initiative will burden an already overtaxed citizenry. We need anything but a bloated government.
But a little memory jog will help. It is argued that the proposed top positions won’t cure divisive politics. Whereas this sounds reasonably true, a ground check reveals conflicting realities.

If in doubt, refer to the Handshake which saw the otherwise national resistance movement placated overnight.
A majority of Kenyans, on any given day, want to see one of their own at the long table of eating chiefs. Apparently, the eater does so in their stead, reason why tribal politics may never end soon.
Equally true is the fact that both pre-election and post-election violence are instigated by political kingpins. Those extra seats are supposedly meant to appease these warlords, lest they incite citizens to violence. Bitter truth it is.





So we are caught in what psychologists call approach-avoid conflict, wherein we want as many of our chiefs to sit in government, yet we are not ready to fund their stay there.
Currently, there is jostling over the proposed extra constituencies. What does this say about us? It reminds me of a craze in recent times where every clan wanted to have their own school.
Corruption is suffocating us. However, it hasn’t been accorded as much attention as the BBI Frankenstein and its alleged 14b magic wand. And when some thief is rounded up from our backyard, we demonstrate on streets in solidarity. 
Missile launchers
This reminds me of the place of the youth in all this. Apparently, they are the most pawned. It’s high time the youth stood to be counted or forever hold their peace. Their political inactivity is befuddling.

Whereas they mill campaign rallies, most of them vanish during polling day. Politicians know this; the more reason they ignore them.
Ask yourself why politicians tell blatant lies during campaigns. They are well aware that their voters are mainly elderly villagers, who can’t make head from tail of their stories!
Idle youth will at best be engaged as tent erectors, hecklers and missile launchers, while those in the middle class indifferently watch the unfolding events on their super plasma screens.
A recent example is when university students attempted a protest upon getting wind of the government’s intention to increase their fees. But they have remained silent whenever injustices are happen. Youth cannot afford to be by-standers. 
If they detest BBI, for instance, they have over 10 million votes with them. But they are equally beholden to tribalism and ignorance; ingredients antithetical to rational decisions.
I’m becoming convinced that Kenyans often get what they deserve. The country has a shortage of fools indeed. Sonko will need 24 elected senators to survive his removal from office. The DP's ally, Feisal Bader, garnered 15,251 votes to trounce ODM’s Omar Boga who secured 10,444 votes in the hotly contested poll. Ministry of Health estimates that the first batch of the recipients will cover 20 per cent of the country’s population.
