Safaricom said the Sh9 billion six-month hit saw the firm report a six per cent drop in net profit to Sh33.07 billion—the first fall in nine years.
At Sh9 billion, the estimated revenue loss is equivalent to 25 per cent of the Sh35.88 billion Safaricom made from the M-Pesa platform in the six months to September and 7.2 percent of total revenue in the same period.
Safaricom said the new cheaper fees will cover 90 per cent of transactions. All transactions of Sh100 and below will remain free and all M-Pesa customers will continue to enjoy free transactions between M-Pesa and bank accounts.
