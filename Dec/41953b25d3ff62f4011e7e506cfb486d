Kenya turned the tables on Cameroon during the qualifiers early this year after Cameroon denied them a chance to compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics.While Malkia Strikers have found their footing once again in Africa, it remains to be seen if they will guard their momentum and push for their presence to be felt at the world stage and more so during the Olympics. The national women’s volleyball team has finally reclaimed its top position in Africa.
According to the continental rankings released at the weekend by the African Volleyball Confederation (CAVB), Malkia Strikers rank ahead of new-found rivals Cameroon who are in second place. The two nations have switched positions based on last year’s ranking.

At the same time, the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) ranked Kenya in position 23 globally, while Cameroon came in 24.
Last year, FIVB placed Kenya in position 19 while Cameroon was ranked 17th.
Kenya occupy the top position owing to their qualification to next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo after playing second fiddle to Cameroon in recent times.

The Paul Bitok-coached side early this year in Yaounde, held their nerves to see off the stubborn hosts 3-2 (25-16, 23-25, 25-21, 23-25 and 15-11) to return to Olympics after a 16-year hiatus.

Kenya had earlier on defeated Botswana, Egypt, and Nigeria to book the sole slot reserved for Africa at the Olympics.
Olympics preparations
Kenya turned the tables on Cameroon during the qualifiers early this year after Cameroon denied them a chance to compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics.
While Malkia Strikers have found their footing once again in Africa, it remains to be seen if they will guard their momentum and push for their presence to be felt at the world stage and more so during the Olympics.
That the team has failed to sparkle at the international stage has left volleyball enthusiasts begging for better results.

In Tokyo, Kenya have been drawn in pool “A” with familiar but tough opponents Korea, European champions Serbia, Dominican Republic, two-time Olympic gold medallists Brazil and the hosts.

Coach Bitok, in a previous interview, said they are eyeing a win in a couple of friendlies.
"We have met before in various championships, although we faltered, we know a thing or two about them. We hope for a win,” said Bitok.
National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOC-K) secretary general Francis Mutuku reassured the team of better preparations.
"We are doing everything possible to ensure the team is well prepared.We are committed to the team's well-being ," said Mutuku.
Men's game stagnating
While the women's team picked up the pieces, their men counterparts have remained dormant and there was nothing much to write home about this year.
The only consolation was that many players turned professional compared to the women.
Sila Kipruto (Saudi Arabia) and Michael Chemos (Israel) both of Kenya Prisons, as well as Abiud Chirchir of General Service Unit (Tunisia ), and Kenya Ports Authority Enock Mogeni (Sweden).
Jane Wacu (Seychelles) was the only female player who turned professional.

The African Africa Games Zone 5 qualifiers held last year was the only event the men's team participated in having finished last in a four-nation tournament.
Eventual winners Egypt, Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda took part in the event.

Volleyball coach Godfrey Okumu, who is attached to University of the Philippines women’s team,  said the gap between the Kenya men and women’s national teams can be bridged if right mechanisms are put in place.
"As a country, the volleyball talent tap can never run dry. But it’s sad that every championship comes with a new coach and really this in a way destabilises the system of play. You can’t have a new coach in every event.
I know many sports, if not all back at home are struggling to get sponsors and volleyball is not any different. But I believe something can be done for the men’s team to attract facilitators. Also having players turn professional would be helpful," Okumu said.
Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) conformed to FIVB where the calendar of events runs between October and June.
Big spenders KCB
The suspended league denied fans and critics the chance to see how KCB Women's Volleyball team would perform in the National League, with the club having been busy in the transfer window.
The bankers brought on board on-form Sharon Chepchumba from Kenya Pipeline and Kenya Prisons duo of  Mercy Moim and soft spoken Edith Wisa.
The three were expected to join forces with left handed Violet Makuto, Leonida Kasaya and Noel Murambi , who on paper form part of the national women's team.

The club was also eager to test its might at the African Clubs Championship, but the event was called off due to Covid-19.
KCB, alongside KVF National League champions Kenya Prisons were to compete in the event by virtue of finishing in the first and second positions last season.
Kenya Pipeline was also set to grace the occasion by virtue of bagging bronze medal during the 2019 African Clubs championship in Egypt.
The event has been rescheduled for next year and Kenya Pipeline will be happy to have influential middle blocker Triza Atuka, who has recovered from a knee injury that saw her miss out on last year's KVF play offs and the Olympic qualifiers, back in action.

GSU and Kenya Ports Authority were to carry the country's flag in the men's category.





On the flip side, national beach volleyball teams' efforts of making it to the Olympics were also cut short by the virus.
At the time, the government’s directive was given against non-essential travel to countries considered as high-risk.
The pair of Gaudencia Makokha and Brackcides Agala, as well as team captain Phoscah Kasisi and Yvonne Wavinya, failed to make the trip to Nigeria for the second round of the Tokyo Games Qualifiers.
Kenya was to battle Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia and Togo in the second round.

Team coach Sammy Mulinge said it will take a lot of convincing for the players to embrace the sport going forward after the failed trip.
“The girls had a big chance of qualifying for the Olympics. I pity the players," said Mulinge.

The men's team, which was to compete against Africa Games champions Gambia,Mauritius, Botswana, South Sudan and the hosts, were to be represented by the pair of Enock Mogeni and Brian Melly, alongside experienced duo Ibrahim Oduor and James Mwaniki.
Team coach Patrick Owino was quoted saying : “As a player, I failed to participate in the Olympics and I had hoped that this will be the perfect opportunity for me to grace the event as a coach. Unfortunately it won’t come to pass. It’s regrettable under the circumstances. The players are heartbroken and there is little I can do."
At the continental front, Amr Elwan's 19-year reign as the Confederation of African Volleyball (CAVB) president came to an end.
Elwan was ousted by Morocco Volleyball Federation chairperson, Hajij Bouchra, during the Electoral Congress conducted virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Bouchra was elected the new CAVB boss after amassing 42 votes to see off the long-serving Egyptian, who got 12 votes. She becomes the first woman to chair the Confederation.

"It's a huge relief that Amr Elwan is now out of the way and volleyball in Africa will take a fresh trajectory. He had become a burden," KVF chairman, Waithaka Kioni said.

Fifty-four National Federations affiliated to CAVB took part in the process that is conducted after four years.





Kioni retained one of the six CAVB vice president positions during the election.
"Accountability and bad governance was the main undoing of Elwan. It is sad that under his reign, the sport in the continent had stagnated and with Bouchra, there is light at the end of tunnel. I know it is early in the day but, I have a good feeling that Bouchra's leadership will be different.
We were dancing to Elwan's music each and every passing year. For instance, most competitions including African Clubs Championship, as well as the Africa Cup of Nations were staged in Egypt.And going forward, I believe things will change," National Olympic Committee of Kenya(NOC-K) deputy president was quoted saying.
As to whether the new sheriff in town will do things differently ,only time will tell.
amakhandia@ke.nationmedia.com Kenya's Waithaka Kioni successfully defended his vice presidential seat with an overwhelming victory. The middle blocker was sidelined for the better part of last season. Man wanted his mother to sell family land and give him the money.
