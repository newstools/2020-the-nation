Information is power and lack of it is dangerous, especially for those living in insecurity-prone areas in Kenya’s northern region where network connectivity is still a challenge. This normally makes it hard for residents to get crucial services which are mostly concentrated in the towns.
It is for this reason that banditry cases in far flung areas are reported at least a day after they happen, as security officers and residents have to travel for many kilometres to climb on trees and hills to make calls to government agencies.

Suspected Al-Shabaab militants have on several occasions destroyed telephone masts in Mandera and Wajir counties in order to disrupt local communication, making it hard for police to seek reinforcements in time and prevent subsequent crimes.
Herders in far flung areas in Merti and Garbatulla in Isiolo County have on several occasions lost their livestock to diseases as they lack information on the county government’s vaccination programmes.

Again, for lack of information on weather, many families get displaced when their houses are marooned by floods.
Expand scope
While the three local radio stations that broadcast in Swahili and Borana play an important role in sharing of crucial information, their scope does not cover the entire Isiolo County, making many residents miss out on information that could have saved their lives and their sources of livelihoods.
In efforts to bridge the gap and complement the efforts made by the radio stations, a philanthropist and a resident of Isiolo, Abdulhakim Abdulrahman, now plans to start a community radio stations that will cover the entire county’s over 25,000 square kilometres.
The radio station, which will broadcast in Somali, Kimeru, Turkana, Borana and Samburu languages, aims at giving voice to residents of the far flung areas. It will also preach peace between the local communities and those in neighbouring counties.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



Promote local culture
Mr Abdulrahman said the station will, apart from providing employment to local residents and raising awareness, promote local culture and provide training opportunities for youths in journalism for them not to indulge in drug and substance abuse.
“It will provide a platform for residents and the marginalised communities in the far flung areas to share their concerns and push for their interests,” he said, adding that the radio station will run programmes on women, children and youths rights, health and talent.
By residents telling their diverse stories and sharing their positive experiences, he said, youths will be empowered to be self-reliant and desist from involvement in crime and promiscuous behaviour.
“Our people will receive useful information on the government programmes and offices they can find assistance from as well as business advice and encouragement,” Mr Abdulrahman said.
He added that the station will endeavour to refrain from politics by all means.
Platform for youth
Talented youths will also be given platform to showcase their prowess and hone their skills.

Ms Anab Kassim, an activist, said the radio station will go long way in ensuring that residents in remote areas access information just like those in urban centres.

“In most cases, they are left out in key decisions and this (radio) will make them be at par with those in towns,” said Ms Anab.
The radio station will also assist in eliminating female genital mutilation, which still remains prevalent in the county, among other outdated practices, she said.
The station, which will be based in Isiolo town, will go on air in January 2021.
