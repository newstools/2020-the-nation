I don’t remember BBI stopping the Ministry of Health, for instance, from using their Covid-19 response funds prudently.I don’t either remember BBI stopping Kenyans from observing Covid-19 prevention protocols, such as wearing of face masks. Imagine a situation where the famous Handshake never happened. Peace is such a tranquiliser, often creating complacency and lethargy among feeble minds.
We seem to have forgotten how the country was increasingly becoming ungovernable. Truly, we never know what we have till we lose it. But that’s beside the point.

I am thinking of a situation where the Building Bridges Initiative, courtesy of the Handshake, never happened as well. Seemingly, we would have made exceedingly large strides towards development.
My hypothesis is informed by the now common trend where almost every failure of the country is attributed to BBI. The narrative has persistently been repeated until the larger populace has come to believe that BBI is responsible for all the country’s woes.
The worst instance is when citizens are made to believe that BBI has largely hampered the war against Covid-19.

Honestly, I don’t remember BBI stopping the Ministry of Health, for instance, from using their Covid-19 response funds prudently. I don’t either remember BBI stopping Kenyans from observing Covid-19 prevention protocols, such as wearing of face masks.
May be the resources spent towards it, however, unspecified, should have been used to bribe them into compliance. BBI hasn’t either stopped government ministries from executing their functions, hence serving the public accordingly.
2022 General Election
And this is where my dalliance with politicians ends. While some sound unreasonably rigid and intolerant to voices of dissent, others pass as opportunists who capitalize on the plight and ignorance of citizens to advance their selfish agenda.

Listening to the two factions – the pro-BBI and the seemingly anti-BBI – one can never be certain of who their genuineness.
There are all signs of dishonesty and selfishness from both camps. A keen eye will notice that the duel has narrowed down to a contest between two individuals.
Mr. Raila Odinga, for instance, seems to have sworn to teach the Deputy President a lesson so that any proposition from the latter is responded to by a defiant ‘nobody can stop reggae’ slogan.
Elsewhere, the visibly agitated DP has fallen into the trap of his nemesis, fighting to disprove him in a manner suggestive of a higher ‘calling’.
With these two, consensus may never be in sight. In fact, the fuss around BBI can easily be attributed to acrimony between the two, a phenomenon that will definitely rope in their followers come the 2022 elections. Residents of Mombasa have been eagerly waiting the commissioning of the bridge. Ms Nthenya was freed without any charges being preferred against her. Just last week, Justice James Rika recused himself from the case after tempers flared in court.
