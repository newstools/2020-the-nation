Now, OCA’s win-win decision last week seems to have set the stage for better diplomatic and economic relations between Doha, Riyadh and the Gulf in general.Sport, once again, has demonstrated its ability to unite the world, just as the famous “ping-pong diplomacy of the 1970s did in fostering good relations between China and USA through table tennis, or the 1914 “Christmas truce” football matches between Germany and Britain when the guns went silent. Last week, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) made an interesting decision on the hosts of the 2030 Asian Games that will transcend sport and help mend the fragile Gulf fabric.
Doha and Riyadh were the candidates to host the 2030 competition and engaged in aggressive campaigns on the back of political tensions between Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

OCA President Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah brokered a "win-win" solution which saw the city with the most votes earn the rights to host the 2030 Games and the second-placed bidder to organise the 2034 action, meaning that Riyadh will now host the latter.
Doha garnered 27 votes against Riyadh's 10 with eight abstentions at Muscat’s JW Marriott Hotel where 26 nations were present and 19 voted virtually.  It will be the second time for Qatar to host the Asian Games, the first time having been in 2006, while 2034 will be the first time for Riyadh to organise the championships.

Hangzhou (China) will host the 2022 edition and Aichi-Nagoya (Japan) the 2026 Games.
In the run-up to last Wednesday’s vote, there was long-standing tension between Qatar and Saudi Arabia with the Saudis accusing Doha of aiding terrorism and backing the “unfriendly” Tehran government, with Riyadh subsequently mustering a regional blockade against the Qataris.
"Hosting the 2030 Asian Games has been a national priority for our country and so we are humbled and greatly honoured to have been awarded this prestigious event,” Doha 2030 chairman and Qatar Olympic Committee President Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad Al-Thani said after his city’s victory last week.

"We are also delighted that our West Asian neighbours, Saudi Arabia, have been given the opportunity to host the 2034 Asian Games and we wish them and the Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee all the best," he added.
"It is the best outcome for the OCA and the two great bid cities who campaigned competitively and in the spirit of great sportsmanship,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Alfaisal, the President of Riyadh 2034 and the Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee, responded.
"We are grateful for the leadership and vision of King Salman and His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and greatly appreciate the support of the Saudi Arabian Government and all those who worked on our bid. We also congratulate Doha and wish them the very best of luck for 2030."

These two statements from erstwhile unfriendly neighbours demonstrated the power of sport in healing political wounds.
In 2017, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates led a five-nation coalition that severed all economic and diplomatic ties with Qatar accusing their neighbours of “embracing various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilising the region.”
The move seriously threatened Qatar’s preparations for the 2022 World Cup.

“Football has been a key weapon in this regional cold war and Qatar’s enemies have realized that the best way to hurt the country is to attack its 2022 World Cup,” Tom Pollitt wrote for Inside Arabia last October.

“The decision to grant the tournament to the Gulf peninsula has received almost universally negative press.
“Accusations of corruption in the 2010 vote abound, ranging from allegations that the Qatari state bribed relevant Fifa officials, to claims that lucrative oil and gas deals played a role in securing hosting rights for the Gulf peninsula.”
Doha has always denied these allegations and bravely fought to acquit themselves with the Gulf blockade also assisting them introspectively in developing self-reliance, especially in food security.

At one point, Fifa President Gianni Infantino even mulled the idea of the Qatar World Cup expanding to 48 teams and increasing the number of host countries in an attempt to stifle the Gulf diplomatic tensions.
Infantino had hoped to see the extra matches hosted in Kuwait and Oman, but the idea was dropped as it was, ironically, seen as a fan to the Gulf tension flames.
Now, OCA’s win-win decision last week seems to have set the stage for better diplomatic and economic relations between Doha, Riyadh and the Gulf in general.

But started blazing again shortly after.
Speaking of Christmas, I wish all of you a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!
May the joy at the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ fill your hearts with abundance.
Spare a thought for us —the people of Nyamira County — as we mourn the loss of our trail-blazing Governor, John Obiero Nyagarama. May his soul rest in eternal peace and may his family, led by Nyamira County First Lady Naomi, be comforted. Poleni sana.
