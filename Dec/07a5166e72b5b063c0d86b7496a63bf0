We love our politics drunk and disorderly.The fact that we cheer on our favourite politicians for saying things for which our grandmothers would kill us reinforces the commonly held belief that we are a nation of hypocrites. This week, the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) went with a thermo gun to Msambweni to take political temperatures, and it gagged at the first speech they scanned.
They returned with a verdict that neither of the two top contenders could lay claim to a clean campaign, concluding that whoever would come up with a detergent that would clean up the political filth Kenyans witnessed around the campaign venues would be a contender for the next Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

We have always known that our leaders only look polished whenever they are signing for sitting allowances in their air-conditioned chambers, but whenever they go down to the grassroots to connect with their people their mouths have always spewed filth only fit for the Dandora dumpsite.
We had hoped that the battery of media cameras in Msambweni would have caused our political class to ask their tailors to stitch their mouths and only leave a small hole for passing food, but we have since discovered that whoever bewitched our politicians died with the antidote.





But worse is the behaviour of the citizens around politicians who defile public order. There were people cheering on when those demeaning statements were being made. The faces were happy, and there was no indication they were bribed to be happy, as they clapped their hands like penguins, laughed hysterically at those distasteful jokes.
It shows we are the ones responsible for abetting these bad manners from our politicians. Kenyans are always in love with drama at first sight. Had drama been a person there wouldn’t have been one Kenyan still single and searching.
We love our politics drunk and disorderly. A politician coming to take us through their manifesto has a higher chance of being booed off stage, but the one with dramatic details of how their opponents have been sneaking into a witchdoctor’s lair at ungodly hours carrying a human skull and drinking crocodile urine will have the DJ punctuate his speech with a shattering jingle to work the crowd into a frenzy just to make it good.

Impeachment
Look at the impeachment of Governor Mike Sonko and the content that was being aired on the Senate floor as evidence of his bad manners. Words that my editor cannot allow to pass on this paper for public consumption were coming out freely from the former governor’s tongue.
You would have thought his mouth would cost him votes, but Mike Sonko received close to a million votes in the last election, despite Nairobi voters being exposed to his unrefined character that even a professional street brawler would be embarrassed to take on.
We might pretend that we love clean and mature politics but deep down we know that given a chance we would drink from a sewage tanker and throw toys off the pram.
The fact that we cheer on our favourite politicians for saying things for which our grandmothers would kill us reinforces the commonly held belief that we are a nation of hypocrites.
We pretend to love politicians of high integrity but we keep voting for ruffians who trade in vile manners and chew public money like ball gum.





This country needs divine intervention to save it from itself, and the first step is for everyone to get the new improved mouthwash that kills 99 per cent of dental germs responsible for verbal diarrhoea.
