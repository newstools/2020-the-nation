Children from poor households in Kyondoni, Kitui County, will have a cheerful Christmas after a Chinese construction firm, Sino Hydro Corporation, donated foodstuffs to needy families.
The foodstuffs, which included wheat flour, maize flour, sugar, cooking oil, biscuits and assorted drinks, were donated through the office of Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua at the weekend.

Speaking when he delivered the foodstuffs at Senator Wambua’s Kyondoni home in Kitui West, Sino Hydro’s Chief Engineer Yun Zeng said the donation was part of the firm’s corporate social responsibility to the local community.
“The senator wrote to us requesting our support in giving poor households Christmas cheer. We responded in the small way we could through this donation,” said Mr Zeng who is in charge of the Kitui-Kibwezi road project.





Yun, who was accompanied by Sino Hydro’s community liaison officer Oliver Waga, said the foodstuffs, which were sourced locally, cost the Chinese company about Sh100,000.
Senator Wambua thanked the company for the gesture, saying it will help him maintain an annual tradition of sharing with the less fortunate people in his home area every Christmas season.

“We’ve been hosting orphaned children and others from destitute families on Christmas day every year for the last eight years even before I was elected to the Senate,” Mr Wambua said.
While appealing to other corporates to support the needy during this festive season, Mr Wambua said the foodstuffs will also be distributed to select children’s homes within Kitui County.
“There’s more suffering among rural households occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic and, as leaders, we are overwhelmed with food appeals and requests from the electorate whose incomes have been hit badly by the virus,” said Senator Wambua.
