Mr Sonko’s father was Gideon Kivanguli. 

Rising from a shrewd businessman to a lawmaker, Mr Sonko’s political journey has been controversial. 

He rose from an MP, to senator to governor in just seven years, a remarkable feat by any standard.

The flamboyant and street smart politician looked subdued at the Senate as he was cross-examined by the Nairobi County Assembly lead counsel Ndegwa Njiru yesterday. 

Accused of grossly violating the Constitution, abuse of office and not being capable of performing functions due to his office, Mr Sonko cut an unassertive figure, a far-cry from the man known for punching walls and hurling expletives. 

Mr Sonko’s quick rise and falling out with the powers-that-be reflects a man who has built his political life on storms and going against the grain. 






Mr Sonko’s life is the stuff for a Hollywood thriller — from reportedly making Sh5 million in Form Four in 1994, having brushes with the law in 1995 to escaping from prison to attend his mother’s burial in 1998 before being rearrested. 

After being pardoned by the court, Mr Sonko would expand his matatu business, which he had begun after forfeiting college education and moving to Nairobi from Mombasa. 

He ran night clubs, cybercafes, salons, boutiques, phone and accessories shops, real estate as well as the tour and travel business. 

Mr Sonko would later be elected the chairperson of the Eastlands Matatu Association. 

The position gave him visibility as the Kikowani Primary School old boy would often champion the rights of young people being harassed and detained by police officers.

The father of three endeared himself to Nairobi residents when he won a court battle in 2007. 

He had gone to court to protest restrictions on matatus in the CBD. 

He would ride on the new-found fame in 2010 to make debut in politics during a by-election in Makadara Constituency at the age of 35. 

Seen as an underdog and vying on little-known Narc-Kenya party ticket, he would floor seasoned politicians, including former MPs Reuben Ndolo (Orange Democratic Movement) and Dick Wathika of the Party of National Unit. 

Mr Sonko repeated the feat three years later when he defeated former Starehe MP and televangelist Margaret Wanjiru of ODM to become the first Nairobi senator on Jubilee party ticket, garnering 808,705 votes against the bishop’s 525,822. 

Fee services 

As senator, he formed the Sonko Rescue Team — an NGO — in 2015, through which he would offer free services to residents of informal settlements. 

Through the Sonko Rescue Team, his reputation as a man ready to splash cash on the poor and helping needy children, youth and women as well as Kenyans in distress grew. 

In 2017, he beat incumbent Evans Kidero of ODM to become the second Nairobi governor. 

It is in Mr Sonko’s time at City Hall that he has weathered a litany of accusations and opposition from city residents and politicians.

The governor’s unorthodox leadership saw him fall out with a number of people, with the once President Kenyatta’s bosom friend seeing his political stakes dwindle dramatically. 

Mr Sonko’s deputy, Polycarp Igathe, resigned just four months after their huge August 8, 2017 election victory. 

He fought Nairobi Metropolitan Services Director-General Mohamed Badi, calling him  “Saddam Hussein”. 

From being given a wide berth during important occasions in the county as well as those involving his fellow governors, the once “first among equals” county boss — who was always just an ear-shot away from the President — had lately been stripped off such privileges missing from a number of State functions attended by the President. 

This was a man who the President kept close even after being arrested in December last year over corruption charges and subsequently being arraigned and then barred from accessing his City Hall office over Sh357 million graft charges. 

Even though he had corruption charges hanging over his head, Mr Sonko still attended a number of State House events much to the ire of many Kenyans who felt he was being treated differently to other governors who were also facing graft charges. 

However, things seem to have taken a turn for the worse for the former senator when he went back on a truce between him and Maj Gen Badi in August, brokered by the Head of State.

Real estate 

An impeachment motion would then be brought and despite his spirited efforts, he would be voted out by 88 MCAs against only two in his support. 

Mr Sonko attended Kikowani Primary School in Mombasa before proceeding to Kwale High School. He would forfeit going to college immediately to venture into business following in the footsteps of his father who was an astute businessman dealing in real estate. 

He would go on to take charge as the manager in the sales and marketing department in his father’s company, Gidson Properties. 

However, his life was not smooth sailing as he had several brushes with law from way back in 1995, when he was arrested and charged with assault.

He was released on bond which was revoked in 1997 which saw him incarcerated at Shimo la Tewa Prison. Sonko would later escape prison in 1998 to pay his last respects to his late mother, Saumu Mukami, who passed on in 1997. 

The City Hall chief joined Pwani Business College and Excel International School in Mwanza to study Business Administration. He would also enroll for a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration at the Kenya Methodist University (KEMU) after 2010. 

The name Sonko came later on in his life because of his philanthropic ways. However, the source of his wealth remains a subject of debate.

} Speaker Benson Mutura challenges MCAs to shed off the “chaotic war zone” tag that has come to define the Assembly. The MCAs had accused the governor of gross violation of the Constitution, abuse of office and gross misconduct. The event was cancelled after the judge arrived late. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i was among leaders who went to Lee Funeral Home to condole with the family. His family says he had difficulty breathing after his lungs collapsed.
