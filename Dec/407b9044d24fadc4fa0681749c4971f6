BBI is nothing but a boring storybook that is being forced on everyone including non-readers.Old age in Africa is not synonymous to retiring from politics.There are no jobs. I went to my mutura joint last Sunday. It is a ritual done for the sake of stomach ministry. I encountered two young men who were engaged in a heated discussion on the Building Bridges Initiative. From a distance, one could have easily mistaken them for a drunken lot and not the future of this nation.

“If you look at it keenly, we really need BBI,” Kimani shot, fearlessly. Why? I thought.
“BBI is nothing but a boring storybook that is being forced on everyone including non-readers. It’s poorly written fiction, if you may” Wajohi retorted. This was getting interesting.
Yes and No camps
“The two of you sound like a “Yes and No teams” already. I think it’s a good place to start the discourse. I will be the IEBC. Let’s go,” I joked.
“Look,” Kimani continued, “It all depends on how you look at it. With a bloated parliament, you stand a chance to be a Mheshimiwa. It is also necessary that you consider most of these people who are supporting BBI are old enough to retire from politics when BBI is passed. Now imagine Mheshimiwa Wajohi?” Kimani argued.

});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



“That argument does not hold water,” Wajohi could not take any of Kimani’s explanation. “You should be initiated in the Kenyan political scene to understand that in Africa, age does not matter. Look at Museveni, how old is the champ? Do you know Bobi Wine was four years when Museveni, now his embittered political rival, took power? That case alone should be enough to convince you that old age in Africa is not synonymous to retiring from politics,” Wajohi picked his metallic cup filled with hot supu from the butcher’s table and gulped.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-2");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



Whether BBI is good and should be adapted, or it is bad and should be discarded, depends largely on the gaze through which one views it.
“Haven’t you read the BBI? It solves all the problems that we are experiencing. Imagine a tax holiday!” Kimani mentioned the mouth-watering promises that he had read in the BBI.
Danger of a single story
“You read it selectively, and that is how you are falling onto the trap and danger of a single, biased story,” Wajohi said sensibly. “Have you considered where you will get a job to raise money to start repaying your HELB after the break? There are no jobs.” Kimani was being a rationalist and a realist. But as the referee, my duty was to remain impartial and objective. But I can assure you it was not an easy task. I was being tossed from one side to the other, at least by ideas, not political strengths and that was a consolation.
“The BBI will create jobs. Or you can employ yourself,” Kimani said with a sense of defeat. He could not defend the ideas stipulated in the BBI for the benefit of Wanjiku.
“That is political talk,” Wajohi said. “A document has never created any jobs. It is as good as if it did not exist, if in the first place the implementers don’t care. After all, it is every man for himself, and God for us all,” Wajohi said.



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-3");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-3']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



“I still maintain that you have to look at the bright side of this document. Don’t focus too much on the shortcomings,” Kimani added, to Wanjohi’s irritation.
“I must add that when the youth ask for jobs from the government, and they are asked to create their own jobs, it is the Kenyan version of Marie Antoinette, who, when asked for bread, told the French to eat cake,” Wajohi finished the discussion with a reflection.



if (shouldRenderAd(false)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("desktop-article-ad-2");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



As the referee, I must say, it was difficult to determine who had won the debate. But of importance was not winning or losing. It was understanding that whether BBI is good and should be adapted, or it is bad and should be discarded, depends largely on the gaze through which one views it. If you look at it from an elitist and bourgeoisie eye, it’s the right document. But if you look at it from the eyes of walala hoi, you’ll despise it. Should the majority decide?
   If the BBI Amendment Bill passes, the youth will be assured of at least two seats at the National Assembly. The handshake has transformed DP William Ruto to an opposition leader in his own government. He served in former president Daniel Moi's cabinet. BBI secretariat cleaned up the 5.2 million signatures that endorsed the Bill, and weeded out 800,000 that had entry irregularities. This comes days after he collapsed at a hotel in Nairobi and was placed under intensive care at Nairobi Hospital.
