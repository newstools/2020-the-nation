Meanwhile, K’Ogalo, having “borrowed” Sammy “Pamzo” Omollo from Posta Rangers for their duel against APR, suffer the additional headache of having to search for a qualified coach to sit on the bench against CR Belouizdad.However, “Jonte” and “Cazorla” are confident that Gor Mahia is a calling, and that someone will certainly come up and lead the mighty green and white past the Algerians. John “Jonte” Ohuma and Josiah “Cazorla” Ochieng, my colleagues at Nation Centre, are both fans of Arsenal and Gor Mahia FC .
And they do practice what they preach, forming an integral part of our staff kick-about football side, Nation FC.
As their team manager, they assure me that, despite the coronavirus having reared its ugly head in March, they have kept match-fit and will be up for selection when we tour Vihiga County in three weeks’ time.

“Jonte” and “Cazorla” have undying love for Gor Mahia FC, which they describe as being more than a football club. To them, enigmatic K’Ogalo is a calling.
That’s why they brushed me aside when I sought to know why they would let shot-stopper David Mapigano defect to Tanzania’s Azam FC after a tug-of-war over unpaid dues.
“Playing for Gor is not about the money. It’s a calling,” stressed “Jonte.”

Well, I begged to differ and still maintain that K’Ogalo must change tack if they wish to move up the pecking order of African club football.
Over the last two weeks, we witnessed the Jekyll and Hyde faces of Gor Mahia.
Bailed out by government tickets and borrowed track-suits, they travelled to Kigali on a shoe-string budget and were lucky to escape with a 1-2 loss to Rwanda’s APR in the preliminary round, first leg match of the Caf Champions League.
Last weekend, they showed the real might of K’Ogalo by scoring two late goals to turn the tie on its head, win the match 3-1 and contest 4-3 on aggregate to make it to the round of 32. 
In two weeks’ time, they face Algeria’s Chabab Riadhi de Belouizdad (CR Belouizdad) for a ticket into the lucrative group stages of Africa’s premier club football tournament.

On Sunday, a strike from Chouaib Keddad and a stoppage time own goal by hosts Al Nasr of Libya’s Salah Fekroune earned CR Belouizdad a 2-0 win on the night, and 4-0 on aggregate, to book a date with “Mighty Gor.”
Winners of the Gor-CR Belouizdad clash will qualify for the group stage and losers drop into the Confederation Cup play-offs.
While you can (almost) always count on Gor to rise up to the occasion on the big stage, like they did in 1987 in winning the Africa Cup Winners’ Cup (Mandela Cup, now Caf Confederation Cup) over Tunisia’s Esperance, it’s sad to see their latter day pedestrian approach to important fixtures.
That they swept past APR is a miracle of sorts, given the amateurish way they approached the fixture, even relying on the philanthropy of politician-cum-consultant-cum-sports enthusiast, Eliud Owalo, for match track-suits on the eve on Saturday’s game at Nyayo National Stadium.
Now they have their begging bowls out, seeking contributions for their next fixture.
This shouldn’t be happening in this day and age at a club that seeks to be Africa’s best!
It’s sad to see Gor treasurer Dolfina Odhiambo take to social media, begging for cash to help pay players’ salaries.

“We need all your support, K’Ogalo lovers,” she posted on Facebook at the weekend.

“We worked so hard to have KBC air Gor vs APR match. I hope you did not just watch for free, but sent at least a VIP ticket amount on the club Paybill for tickets and membership 350100, account number, your name (VIP is normally 500 while VVIP is 1,000),” she wrote.
“May we kindly motivate the boys… The money will go a long way to clear their salary arrears bearing in mind that we can't sell tickets nor have attendance in the matches yet,” she begged.
Really? A club of Gor’s stature moving around with begging bowls?
The treasurer had earlier posted that they relied on Sh1 million from well-wishers and a personal contribution of Sh75,000 from club chairman Ambrose Rachier to supplement the Sh2 million from club sponsors Betsafe ahead of the Kigali fixture.
Rather than fund-raise on social media to make ends meet, Rachier, Odhiambo and the K’Ogalo executive need long-term marketing programmes that will do justice to Kenya’s most successful football club.
Gor’s pedigree demands that, by now, they should have an advance party of officials off to Belouizdad on a fact-finding mission and to lay ground for their visit, lest they fall victim to the traditional North African off-the-pitch shenanigans and take a hammering at the Stade du 20 Aout 1955 in the first leg match on December 22.

But, hey, is this possible for a club that’s relying on Facebook friends to raise players’ salaries?
CR Belouizdad’s coach, 52-year-old Frenchman Franck Dumas, must have sent the Gor treasurer a friend request to gleefully follow the circus at K’Ogalo, merely as foreplay.
Having played for, inter alia, French Ligue 1 sides Monaco, Marseille and Lens alongside Newcastle in the English Premier League during his pro career from 1987 to 2004, Dumas certainly has the experience to lead his side into the group stages.
Meanwhile, K’Ogalo, having “borrowed” Sammy “Pamzo” Omollo from Posta Rangers for their duel against APR, suffer the additional headache of having to search for a qualified coach to sit on the bench against CR Belouizdad.





However, “Jonte” and “Cazorla” are confident that Gor Mahia is a calling, and that someone will certainly come up and lead the mighty green and white past the Algerians.
Remember: The Paybill number is 350100, and account number is your name!
