It is now getting to a critical point that 80 per cent of the population is under 35 years.Our democracy has made gains over the years, which justifies inclusion of critical constituencies — among them the youth — in any political discourse and debate. As Kenyans celebrate Jamhuri Day, it should offer a reflective moment on the foundation of our nation, which was premised on the wrong footing as far as the welfare of the youth is concerned- both in leadership and economic prosperity.
Although the state was crafted by a cabal of young people, a mechanism of creating room for the next generation has been lacking, leading to accumulation of resources and domination of power among a few people- leading to the huge wealth inequality we are facing today as a nation.

It is now getting to a critical point that 80 per cent of the population is under 35 years. There is an undeniable fact here that youth voice and action must be considered as essential in bringing about change and lasting solutions in the country’s crises.
Turmoil and instability
The struggle for independence, multiparty and the 2010 Constitution are some of the positive heritage of Kenya’s old generation. Our democracy has made gains over the years, which justifies inclusion of critical constituencies — among them the youth — in any political discourse and debate.

The challenges facing the country, critical being the division between haves and have-nots, call for bold approaches to building a better country.
This divide is likely to create a country characterised by more turmoil and instability. No one can rest comfortably in a country where the rich cannot sleep because the poor are awake and hungry, as African saying goes.
It is the responsibility of the country and its youth to take bold steps required to make Kenya more inclusive, free of corruption, ethnicity among other vices that continue to inhibit progress.
This can only be achieved if economic and social development programmes are deliberately planned to incorporate youth agenda. Presently, due to their worsening plight, many young people feel betrayed by the country they love.

Despite all the progress that Kenya has made, youth remain the perpetual other — always on the outside or in the waiting room. But young people must not continue to sit back and complain.
The idea of making Kenya better and great is not the sole responsibility of the government or politicians. It is the glorious task of all Kenyans — especially young people.
Poor state
Youth do not need politicians or civil society honchos prompting them to be angry about their poor state. They got all the reasons to be angry and to take constructive action.
The fact is that it is the same politicians who are standing between them and the new Kenya. Across the country, many young people are doing amazing work to bring about change and real progress – and to create a better future for everyone.
This must continue, and be consolidated at all levels; local and national. Looking at the situation of Kenyan youth, one would be justified to say that Kenya is still far from real freedom.
Noteworthy, inequality and corruption are still the main enemies of marginalised groups in Kenya. Sadly, the growing population of youth is viewed as a problem instead of a benefit to Kenya that can spur the economic growth.
In this year’s Jamhuri Day, it is good to remind ourselves of the important role the youth of Kenya have played and must continue to play to transform their livelihoods and to build a better Kenya.

As the former President of South Africa Thabo Mbeki once noted, for youth to change this sad state of affairs, they must rebel against the existing order. We must refuse to play by the script designed by the authority, mainly people who benefit from the status quo.
Youth must refuse to be passive recipients and instead play an integral role in advocating for their rights and the realisation of socio-economic and political independence. This is the only way they will truly be free and prosper.
