Today’s Cabinet secretaries are arguably the most explicitly empowered cohort in Kenya’s Executive history.Our Cabinet secretaries are formidably installed in the heart of Kenya’s official VIP culture as veritable demigods; they lack for nothing. We are not doing well at all. A limping economy starting to stagger ominously on the brink of implosion. Debt. A relentless, rampaging and devastating Covid-19 pandemic. The youth unemployment time-bomb. Corruption.
Official cluelessness and heartlessness. A friend from Baragoi advised me that over there, if a swift messenger calls on the leader of the warriors and whispers, “iko shida manyatta,” matters are exceedingly out of hand.

At the moment, the government’s public standing is severely battered, with doubts frequently voiced about whether anyone “in there” has anything figured out. Depending on who you speak to, two dire scenarios are suggested: impending government failure, or wholesale state failure.
Paradoxically, we live at a time of tremendous burgeoning of ministerial clout. Today’s Cabinet secretaries are arguably the most explicitly empowered cohort in Kenya’s Executive history.





The President has formally delegated important functions to Cabinet secretaries, to be performed individually through line mandates, or through thematic Cabinet sub-committees and multiagency focal points.
Essentially, they have the ability to speak and act on behalf of government in meaningful ways. Obviously, the intention of this empowerment was to hasten the President’s feet and hands in delivering his agenda and burnishing a legacy of transformational achievement.
A lavish incentive comes with this: our Cabinet secretaries are formidably installed in the heart of Kenya’s official VIP culture as veritable demigods; they lack for nothing.
Yet here we are. How come, and what gives, then? This newspaper recently reported that the president’s wishes have been falling on deaf ears since 2015 in regards to e-procurement (All bark and no bite: A look at Uhuru’s often ignored e-tendering orders, September 7, 2020).

Casual treatment
With rampant irregularities dogging the entire public sector, the casual treatment of the presidential directive by his subordinates is cause for a lot of angst. I may add at this point that this defiance of the President is not necessarily confined to procurement matters, and may be key to understanding a lot of the things going south in our country today.
The Public Service Commission’s annual evaluation reports on compliance with the National Values and Principles of Governance and the Values and Principles of the Public Service illuminates the extent of this bureaucratic insolence.
Consider, first, that these evaluations are the basis of the President’s mandatory report under Article 232 as well as the State of the Nation Address. Consider also that when the commission tracked compliance with presidential directives, it measured a considerable failure rate. Further, ponder the fact that the commission has had to sternly remark about ministries, departments and agencies wilfully refusing to participate in the evaluation.
Finally, please reflect on the fact that no Cabinet secretary is on record taking issue with this recalcitrance, nor expressing any remorse for such sabotage of the president’s constitutional mandate. What is the source of this impunity?

It seems that many functionaries misconstrued the delegation of functions and forgot their place. Instead, they imagine themselves as being in a political settlement with the Chief, like the barons-warlords of the Magna Carta. As a result, the relationship between principal and agent implicit in such situations has all but collapsed, or been reversed!
A principal delegates a task to an agent, who is contracted to act at all times in the principal’s best interests. The agent is fully empowered to the extent necessary to secure the principal’s interests.
Monitoring mechanism
But the whole point of the relationship is to free the principal to do other things, and basically trust the agent. Without effective monitoring, nothing stops the agent from selfishly (ab)using their informational advantage and presence on the ground, and the principal will be none the wiser.
Our parliament long ago abdicated their role of becoming this effective monitoring mechanism. This abdication occurred simultaneously with the tremendous increase in Executive muscularity, which was then donated in good faith to secretaries.
Although the most muscular of these secretaries never miss a chance to proclaim to the world that they are helping the President achieve this and that, our dismal situation as a country testifies to the contrary. Without a doubt, they are helping themselves.

In any event, they speak a language that is patronising to the point of infantilising. There is a whole industry of busybodies viciously embarked on self-assigned missions to protect the President, demand respect and exact political revenge on his behalf. Awkwardly enough, none of them is as zealous in advancing the Big 4 Agenda or ensuring administrative coherence.
Kemsa paid a “passer-by”Sh180 million, but there was no money to keep Dr Stephen Mogusu safe from infection, treat him or pay his salary. It is said by public policy theorists that government failure is just a series of principal-agent problems. This is where we find ourselves.

Iko shida manyatta.
@EricNgeno He served in former president Daniel Moi's cabinet. BBI secretariat cleaned up the 5.2 million signatures that endorsed the Bill, and weeded out 800,000 that had entry irregularities. This comes days after he collapsed at a hotel in Nairobi and was placed under intensive care at Nairobi Hospital.
