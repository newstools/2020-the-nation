Police are investigating how an armed police officer was disarmed and two security guards tied up by thugs who broke into the house of industrialist Manu Chandaria in the secure Muthaiga Estate in Nairobi.
The seven robbers, one armed with a pistol, reportedly stole Sh600,000 and assorted jewellery from Mr Chandaria’s bedroom after allegedly snatching a loaded G3 rifle from Police Constable Jared Omboga Makombe, who was assigned to guard the premises.

Two G4S guards, Judah Wafula and Stephen Omwega, were also reportedly stripped naked by the robbers and tied up, and detectives will also question how the guard dog was retrained by the intruders.
Police will also establish how the thugs gained entry into the compound given the main gate did not appear to have been tampered with, and it is reinforced with an electric fence. An assessment of the gate showed no sign of forced entry. It is also not clear how the gang was able to operate during the curfew hours given the high security presence in the area.

No one injured
DCI George Kinoti Monday said the attackers demanded money from Mr Chandaria and his wife at gunpoint, but no one was injured during the incident.
“He showed them the safe, which they broke and took away an unknown amount of money and some jewellery. They then left the house while firing using a G3 rifle, which they had robbed from the police officer who was guarding the home,” Mr Kinoti said.
DCI said the billionaire heard a loud bang at the main door and rang the security phone, but it was not answered. A few minutes later, he saw two thugs, one armed with a pistol and another armed with a metal cutter.
“They ordered Mr Chandaria and his wife to give them money at gunpoint. He showed them the safe. They broke it and took away an unknown amount of money and some jewellery. They then left the house while firing using a G3 rifle loaded with 20 rounds of ammunition, which they had robbed from APC Jared Omboga, who was guarding the home,” noted a police report.

Gun found
The weapon was later found in a nearby bush with 17 rounds of ammunition.
The officer also claimed that he had been without a phone for the last one week. Police are verifying his account.
One guard will be asked to explain how the robbers managed to access the front yard undetected as he manned the gate reinforced with an electric fence.
Kenya Power officials assessed the residence’s fencing Monday morning to determine if it had been tampered with.
The second guard will be pressed to explain how the dog was contained before he was also tied alongside his colleagues as the robbers accessed the main house.
The guards, who were found without their uniforms, told detectives that the robbers took the officer’s trousers and smoke jacket and their G4S uniforms.
“The officer was found in his boxers while the guards were in ordinary clothes, which they said they were forced to wear by the robbers,” sources told the Nation.
Arrested for questioning
The three were arrested and separately booked into Muthaiga, Pangani and Huruma police stations for questioning.





Police said the robbers made their way out of the compound through the back of the residence that leads to Karura Forest.
The sound of the gunshots alarmed neighbours, who, some in response, also started firing in the air in panic shortly before the arrival of Recce officers and a team led by Nairobi Regional Police Commander Rashid Yakub.

The robbery came as a shocker to many owing to the residence’s location. Muthaiga is home to some of the country’s wealthiest and most prominent personalities, dignitaries and expatriates. It also hosts the residence of the US Embassy. Police suspect the robbery was an inside job.
