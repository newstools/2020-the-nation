Teachers have planned a strike in January when schools open.Nurses, clinical officers, police officers, youth and women all have different grievances against this government. This week, doctors were supposed to be on strike, but they postponed it to allow for talks with the government. The same government that sold donated protective gear.
The same government that has not paid their salaries and insurance cover against the very disease they are supposed to be helping Kenyans fight.

But they are not alone. Teachers have planned a strike in January when schools open. Nurses, clinical officers, police officers, youth and women all have different grievances against this government.
Given how the past seven years have panned out for Kenyans, it should be clear by now that demonstrations, strikes, begging and petitioning this government does not work.
 How do you convince the same person who sold donated personal protective equipment to issue them?  How can someone stab you and you run back to them for healing?

The only way any of these groups is going to get good working conditions is if the system of governance works. 
Kenyans put in place this bad government, which has overseen wanton corruption, breakdown of the rule of law, retrogression, a dying economy and rising debt, and only they can remove it. But that won't happen if we keep on dividing themselves into small groups of victims.
They say tough times call for tough measures. It is time doctors looked to their patients for help, for teachers to beseech their students’ parents for support. 
Calling on Kenyans for support means ensuring that the next batch of leaders get into office knowing that all Kenyans — not just doctors — are extremely invested in ensuring that the Ministry of Health works.

});
}, 62000);

It's time Kenyans realised that as a whole they are a force to reckon with, but as small groups, they just have no voice.
