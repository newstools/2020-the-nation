Other high-risk frontliners like police and teachers should then be considered for prioritisation depending on their deployment status.Our vaccination strategy must aim at protecting those at greatest risk of death, in our case those aged 60 years and above. As we approach the end of this truly terrible year in recent human history due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there are multiple rays of hope that we must nurture and harness in the coming year.
Several pharmaceutical companies have now produced and tested vaccines that are on track to receive emergency use authorisation in many parts of the world.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



The challenge now for our government is to start thinking strategically about distribution and use of these vaccines.
However, there have been worries about our ability to store and transport these vaccines, and these must be quickly dispensed with. Firstly, several hospitals and research labs in this country have the capacity to store the vaccines at temperatures as low as -80 degrees centigrade.
Secondly, newer vaccines have been developed that do not require such low temperatures and can be stored in the same equipment currently being used in most hospitals to store other vaccines and medication requiring refrigeration.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



The challenge of storage is, therefore, surmountable and should not bother us too much at this point.
The more pertinent question is whether the government has identified a vaccine suitable for our population, and whether sufficient thinking has gone into the amount of resources required to procure sufficient quantities to protect our population.

Further, we must ask whether we have thought through the criteria we will use to prioritise vaccine recipients in the inevitable event that the quantities procured are limited.
We cannot depend on strategies developed in high-income countries that have different population structures and priorities. In Kenya, a Covid-19 vaccine strategy must be more customised.



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-2");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



Firstly, it is estimated that there are not more than 100,000 health workers in Kenya. It is, therefore, quite straightforward to ensure that they are given priority in order to reduce the risk to themselves and to those that come into contact with them.
Other high-risk frontliners like police and teachers should then be considered for prioritisation depending on their deployment status. This first phase of prioritisation is aimed at ensuring continuity of vital social services while limiting the risk of spread of the virus in the population by targeting the high-risk segments.
Secondly, our vaccination strategy must aim at protecting those at greatest risk of death, in our case those aged 60 years and above. We estimate these elders to be about two million in our population, and even if we were only able to vaccinate those, we would significantly reduce the deaths related to Covid-19.
The other important population to protect would then be those with underlying conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Unfortunately a huge proportion of our population has these conditions, and most of those remain undiagnosed.
Our vaccination strategy must, therefore, treat these on a case-by-case basis, by creating an algorithm that stratifies risk and prioritises those at highest risk of death and severe disease.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-3");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-3']]);
});
}, 62000);
}






if (shouldRenderAd(false)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("desktop-article-ad-2");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



As we take all these measures, we must remain vigilant and continue with the public health interventions including physical distancing and restricting mass gatherings, as well as the hygiene measures that have had a real impact on infectious diseases.
My greatest wish for Kenya in 2021 is to see an articulated government Covid-19 vaccination strategy that covers the items enumerated here, and to get to the end of 2021 with a country that is largely Covid-free!
