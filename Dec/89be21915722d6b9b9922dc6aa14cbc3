“I know the expectations of our fans are high and all I want is for the players to target good results as we start reviving the once-vibrant club,” the former Thika United player, who also turned out for Shabana, said.
The Kisii-based team, which is one of the title favourites in the second-tier league, is determined to win promotion to the top-tier.
Kisumu Hot Stars earned a slot in the second-tier league after replacing the struggling Chemelil Sugar FC. Chemelil's management withdrew the playing unit from the league due to financial challenges facing the sugar millers.

Chemelil were relegated to the NSL league alongside Sony Sugar FC. Cash-strapped Sony Sugar were relegated after forfeiting three league matches last season. The team could not even honour a home match due to financial difficulties.
Sony, under the tutelage of former Kenyan international Tillen Oguta, will be away to NSL newbies Silibwet Leons at Silibwet grounds in Bomet, while Kibera Black Stars will start this season's campaign on Sunday against Murang’a Seal.
Black Stars will be eying a top finish this season as they hope to avoid relegation dog fights that they have had to contend with at the end of the past two seasons.
