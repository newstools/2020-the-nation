KVF officials and team managers drawn from all participating clubs held a meeting on Saturday in Nairobi where draws were conducted ahead of new season.
KVF treasurer Kenneth Tonui said the federation was looking at four facilities that will stage the league that has previously been played outdoors except the play-offs.
The four facilities are Makande Hall in Mombasa, Africa Nazerene University, Bomas of Kenya and Moi International Sports Centre Indoor Arena, Kasarani. Both Makande and Kasarani have hosted the playoffs in the last few seasons.





"We will have matches spread across the four facilities and if all goes well, the season is scheduled to end in June. We are glad Nairobi Water women's team is back in league having been out of action for a while," said Tonui.
"Going forward, we will be at per with other nations that have their league matches indoor and, in many occasions, have had an upper hand in championships.”
Nairobi Water last featured in the league in 2017 before the team was disbanded due to financial constraints.Nairobi Water team manager Rukia Suleiman said they were happy to back in the league and all the logistics are in place.
"We are excited to back in the league and we can only hope for the best. We are indebted to the management for giving us another chance,” Suleiman said.
