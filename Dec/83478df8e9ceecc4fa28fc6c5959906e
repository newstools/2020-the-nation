Days after losing his seat as Nairobi governor after the Senate affirmed his impeachment, Mike Sonko has broken his silence since, blaming the State for his woes. 

In the wee hours of Saturday morning, the former City Hall boss took to social media, posting a long read summing up the recent happenings at the Senate.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-1");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}




Posting a video of himself on the steering wheel listening to a gospel song, the former Makadara MP was cryptic at best. 

Like a man in great pain and yet to come to terms with his new life, all posts on his social media platforms have centred on his impeachment, lamenting over the “injustice” against him. 

“As I said before, there is life after politics, and I am excited to go back to my life and to be with the ordinary people who have been supporting me all my political life," said Sonko.

});
}, 62000);
}

‘Purely political’ 

He went on to accuse some unnamed individuals from the State of being behind his woes at the Senate, saying his impeachment was “purely political and not based on any solid grounds”. 

He further linked the “dynasty-hustlers” divide as having played a crucial role in his impeachment by senators as “he is not a member of Kenya’s political dynasty”. 

“Some of my former colleagues in the Senate had to sacrifice me because of the party political pressure from their party bosses who personally called them one by one to impeach me…,” the former senator said. 


The greatest tragedy in life is not getting knocked down. The greatest tragedy in life is refusing to get up after being knocked down. Today I may appear down but I'm not because I know my victory is soon coming back. Have a merry Christmas and Happy New Year. pic.twitter.com/WmTr1cOXL0— Mike Sonko (@MikeSonko) December 19, 2020  

Sonko was impeached on Thursday after 27 senators voted to have him removed from office, upholding the resolution by Nairobi MCAs to oust him. Only 16 voted against his removal.

});
}, 62000);
}




He was facing charges including abuse of office, gross violation of the Constitution, gross misconduct and crimes under national law. 

In the aftermath of his removal as Nairobi governor, Sonko sounded bullish, saying he had just been impeached by senators and not the city residents who elected him in 2017. He said he is sure his victory is soon coming. 

“The greatest tragedy in life is not getting knocked down. The greatest tragedy in life is refusing to get up after being knocked down. Today, I may appear down but I'm not because I know my victory is soon coming back,” he said. 

It is not clear whether the former governor will still go to court to challenge his ouster even as Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Benson Mutura is set to be sworn in Monday as the acting governor. 

Sonko urged his supporters, who have been with him in his 10-year political journey, not to waver as he will still be with them. 

 

comulo@ke.nationmedia.com The goose is almost cooked for Mike Mbuvi Kioko Sonko, the man who ruled Nairobi with a gaudy display of power and opulence. Can he wiggle out of this? The deep-rooted rivalry between Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and NMS boss Mohammed Badi has taken a new turn. Regional leaders are expected to hold a meeting in Djibouti Sunday. DP has borrowed Tanzania’s Chama Cha Mapinduzi model, constituting campaign committees in villages. The legislator suggested that she was being targeted because of her political stand.
