Villagers want the road tarmacked to help alleviate their suffering and open market opportunities.Area residents said farmers are unable to ferry their output to the market due to the poor state of the road. Residents of Kamore in Naivasha, Nakuru County have petitioned the government to rehabilitate a crucial road in the far flung village which is currently impassable.
They held demonstrations on Saturday, accusing both the county and national governments of neglecting them for years.
Peter Kaara, a resident and former senior chief, said the road was gravelled during the administration of the first President Jomo Kenyatta.

"We were recently forced to part with Sh12,000 to have the road paved to enable us bury a fellow villager," said the former administrator.
He accused successive regimes of having given the agriculturally rich rural area a wide berth, subjecting the locals into untold sufferings.
"Three people have died while being taken to hospital due to the poor state of the road network. It is a shame in this era and age," added Mr Kaara.





Farm produce going to waste
His sentiments were echoed by local leader, Francis Mwaniki, who said their farm produce, including milk, is going to waste due the poor state of the road.
Worst hit, he disclosed, are pyrethrum farmers who are also unable to ferry their produce to the market. This is despite pyrethrum being the main cash crop in the area.
"We are also tax payers and we demand better services from the concerned authorities,” said Mr Mwaniki.
He said most of the earth roads were washed away by floods, disconnecting several rural homes.
"We have instances where expectant mothers have given birth by the roadside, jeopardising their health and that of their young ones. This is simply unacceptable," stated Mr Mwaniki.
The locals described the road as vital as it connects them to the three counties of Nyandarua, Kiambu and Narok.

They called for the tarmacking of the road to help alleviate their sufferings and open up market opportunities.
The villagers, at the same time, called on the government to intervene in a land row involving a private developer accused of having grabbed a five-acre farm set aside for a nursery school.
A resident, Mariah Njenga, who has resided in the area for the past 50 years, expressed dismay after a nursery school was torched by unknown assailants a week ago.
