Embattle Knut Secretary General gets the support of seven top officials.Sossion's supporters tell his detractors to wait for elections scheduled for next year. Seven Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) officials on Wednesday threw their weight behind Secretary- General Wilson Sossion and distanced themselves from a plot to have him barred from seeking re-election. 

The seven, who include Knut acting chairman Collins Oyuu and secretaries for Baringo, Mwingi, Mombasa, Kakamega East and Kajiado branches, took issue with a claim that 10 officials who signed a letter to the President and the Labour Cabinet secretary were representing 90 branch secretaries.

“In every working environment there can never miss disharmony. What I know is that only 10 met. That they represented over 90 branch executive secretaries is not known to me,” said Mr Oyuu. 

Baringo Knut executive secretary Joshua Cheptarus said the 10 were speaking on their behalf and not for the 110 branch executive secretaries.

});
}, 62000);
}




Anyone opposed to Mr Sossion should wait for elections scheduled for next year, he added. 

Mwingi branch secretary Michael Munyasia said he had confidence in the leadership of Mr Sossion. 

Disowned the letter 

Kericho branch woman representative Ann Cheruiyot, who is also a national executive council member, also disowned the letter. 

“We were not involved in the writing of the letter and therefore it cannot be the voice of branch secretaries or Knut teachers,” Ms Cheruiyot said. 

Mombasa executive secretary Dan Aloo said his branch had not been consulted about the move against Mr Sossion. He added that it (the branch) fully supports the secretary-general. 

Kakamega East branch executive secretary Patrick Chungani said the people claiming to oppose Mr Sossion were being used to fight him. 

“There is nothing that Sossion has done to teachers to warrant his removal. Come next year, the teachers of this country will re-elect him as our secretary general,” said Mr Chungani, who is also the Knut western region chairman.

Kajiado branch secretary Elly Korinko said the group of 10 executive secretaries just wants to cause disharmony in the union. 

“We’re ready for elections and no one sent any group to go represent us. We’re able to speak on our behalf,” Mr Korinko said. At least 90 out of 110 Knut branch secretaries want Mr Sossion blocked from vying in union elections. Secretary-General Wilson Sossion said the polls, which will culminate in the election of national officials, will proceed despite financial challenges. Sonko will need 24 elected senators to survive his removal from office. The DP's ally, Feisal Bader, garnered 15,251 votes to trounce ODM’s Omar Boga who secured 10,444 votes in the hotly contested poll. Ministry of Health estimates that the first batch of the recipients will cover 20 per cent of the country’s population.
