I like pastors at Nairobi’s Citam (Christ is the Answer Ministries) because of their practical, as opposed to dogmatic, approach to preaching. They address issues of the here and now before they tell us about the hereafter. 

One of my favourites is the former bishop of the church, David Oginde. My other great was Pastor Dennis White, who has since returned to his country of origin, Canada.

I still remember a long conversation I had with him about three decades ago. I had sought to briefly interview him on the subject of youth delinquency but he turned it into a full-blown sermon on four pillars Kenyans should stick to if we were to be the great nation we aspire to be. 

That was in the 1990s. Today, Pastor White would shudder at what he saw as a worrying trend. 

 Seek God 

The very first value he said we should embrace is repentance and return to godliness. He said it couldn’t have been a mistake that founders of the Kenyan nation found it fit to open our national anthem with the words: “Oh God of all creation, bless this our land and nation.”

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}




With faith and obedience to God, Pastor White said, we would be in safer hands than if we had a million-strong army or even a nuclear weapon. 

He reminds me of former US President Ronald Reagan who, in the 1980s,  came up with a grand idea to install in the American skies and those of her allies an anti-missile protective shield to permanently keep off the Russians and other potential enemies. The project, which never saw the light of day, was dubbed the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI) or simply the Star Wars, and was to cost arm and a leg.

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}




When world-famous US televangelist Bill Graham heard about it, he secured an appointment with President Reagan and told him: “Mr President, why put up such an expensive shield in the skies when our national motto ,‘In God We Trust,’ is all we need to protect us from our enemies?” 

 Parents lost in Siberia 

The second value Pastor White talked about is going back to old parenting. He regretted that though physically staying with their children, technology and the modern lifestyle has seen children live in Alaska and the parents in Siberia, under the same roof. Mark you at the time mobile phone and the tablet hadn’t arrived. 

Today, you drop in on a typical household and you will be surprised by the strangers living together in name of a family. In the living room, the father has no time to talk to the children because he is permanently fixated on the TV watching the European Premier League. 

The wife is at the far corner catching up on latest from WhatsApp groups, and each of the children is in their own world scrolling for the latest photos of their favourite influencer on social media. 

Are you surprised that  the teenagers caught in the Mountain View house of sin had been away for days and their parents unaware of their whereabouts!

googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-3']]);
});
}, 62000);
}




Mark you, these days it sounds “cool” for children to call to say they are “sleeping over” at a friend’s house, a “friend” whom the parents have never met but perhaps don’t give a hoot about. 

I come from the old school and can proudly say except when in boarding school, until I was 22, there isn’t a single day my mother went to bed without knowing where I was. Even today , as an old man with my own family, when at my rural home I find it difficult to leave the compound without telling ma’am where I am going and when I will be back.

googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}




 Back to basics 

The third lesson from Pastor White was that Kenyans should get back to such basic little things like saying “please,”“thank you,” and “I am sorry”. Just take a sampling from wherever you are – while keeping social distance – and you will be surprised that not more than three in 10 people will utter any word of courtesy. 

 Obey the 10 Commandments 

It sounds easy but you will be surprised that though over 70 per cent of the Kenyan adult population goes to church, the last time they read the short passages containing the 10 Commandments was in Sunday school class. At that rate I wonder who will read the BBI report! 

Reading the 10 Commandments is a humbling but surest way to remind one to keep to the straight and narrow even when the spirit is willing but the fresh is weak.

Allow me to tell a little story: As a little boy, I loved singing. One day, a member of the adult choir forgot a tambourine inside the church. I took the set home. The first question my mother asked was how I came to “own” the tambourine. 

When I told the story, she told me to tell her what the sixth commandment says, then she said: “Taking people’s things without their consent is stealing. So what to do right now is run back to the church and put the tambourine back where you picked it.” 

She didn’t punish me, but I learnt a life  lesson. I am no saint but to this day I find myself returning change mistakenly given to me even by the barman. 

 School not just for As 

At the time I spoke with Pastor White, Citam was in the process of investing in the education sector, a venture which has since blossomed from kindergarten to a university. 

He told me the aim was to demonstrate that school shouldn’t just be place to get secular education and score As but also ground for building a wholesome person who has values and ethos besides education. 

He reminded me of my days in high school when the best schools were mostly those learn by the church and missionaries. 

 

*** 

As we celebrate Christmas this week, please let us reflect and plan a return to the old golden values. We can never go wrong in that direction.
