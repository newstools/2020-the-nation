A magistrate’s court in Maua, Meru County has jailed 10 Ethiopians who were arrested for being in the country illegally six months each. The court gave them the option of paying Sh100,000 fine each for their freedom.
The 10 men pleaded guilty before Maua Principal Magistrate Carol Obara, who noted that cases of Ethiopians using Maua town as their getaway route while heading to other destinations are on the rise.

Eyash Adore, Jamilu Tadesse, Defefe Abere, Mintasonot Abara, Seid Kedir, Adisse Petroc, Tariko Somano, Mesfin Bobicho, Siyan Duma and Ashetu Debito were arrested while traveling in a Toyota Prado (KCQ 426Q).
Police officers from Mutuati who were on patrol along the Mutuati-Gachuru road became suspicious of the vehicle and upon inspection, spotted the illegal immigrants.
Driver charged
Mr Robert Muriithi Mugo, the driver of the vehicle, denied charges of smuggling the foreigners and was released on Sh100,000 cash bail or Sh200,000 surety.

While delivering the sentence, Ms Obara noted that infiltration of illegal immigrants has contributed to insecurity and poses a threat in the spread of Covid-19.
She agreed with State Counsel Kang'ethe Gitogo who called for stringent bond and fines to curb the vice.
"The issue of foreigners using the Maua route is on the rise and is a threat to national security and [can lead to] spread of Covid-19. I ask the court to take stern action to end it," he said.
A local miraa trader interpreted the charges to Amharic for the Ethiopians.
Ms Obara ordered that the 10 be deported back to their country upon completion of their sentence or after paying the fines.
