Britons who feel they are living in a state of permanent crisis received some relief last week with the start of a nationwide vaccination campaign against the coronavirus pandemic.
This nine-month-long purgatory has killed more than 61,000 people in the UK, devastated the economy and disrupted many thousands of lives in an unprecedented way.

As a result, photos and TV film of health workers and older people happily receiving Pfizer inoculations on December 8 were hailed as the beginning of a fightback and, hopefully, a return to normality in 2021.
But just as hopes rose for an eventual end to the scourge of Covid, the spotlight focused on another crisis — Britain’s future relations with the continent of Europe.
When a slim majority of Britons voted narrowly four years ago for Brexit (Britain’s exit from the European Union), supporters happily declared that the country could make a new trade deal with Europe on better terms, or if necessary, go it alone. However, the grinding pace of current negotiations is telling a different story.





Fishing rights
At the time of writing, significant differences remain on issues such as fishing rights (who can fish where and catch what), the rules of fair competition known as the level playing field, enforcement of agreements, and the Northern Ireland border question.
It is probably little consolation to those who voted to stay in Europe to learn of the trend demonstrated by recent opinion polls on the Brexit question.
A sampling of opinion on November 30 showed that if given the choice today, 74 per cent would now vote to remain in Europe, against 67 per cent who would still leave. A poll taken five days later increased the lead for Remain from six points to nine.

The tide, it seems is turning, just too late.

Aiming to crack down on out-of-control gambling, the government has ordered that the age limit for playing the National Lottery be raised from 16 years to 18 from next October.
The number of problem gamblers in the UK, those who play beyond their means, is estimated at 340,000, many of them teenagers. They are more likely to come from a black background than a white or Asian one and from the poor rather than the well off.
Some desperate gamblers resort to theft and violence or end up in hospital with psychotic conditions. Campaigners want gambling abuse to be seen as a public health issue like smoking, obesity and alcoholism.
Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said last week that the betting industry had evolved “at breakneck speed”. He promised that the government would undertake a wide-ranging review to tackle “problem gambling in all its forms to protect children and vulnerable people”.
Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston noted that patterns of play had changed in recent years, with a shift towards online games. The increased age limit would help ensure that the National Lottery was not a gateway to problem gambling, he said.

A pipe burst in a doctor’s house, so he called a plumber. The plumber unpacked his tools, fiddled around for 10 minutes, then handed the doctor a bill for £300. “This is outrageous,” said the doctor. “I don’t even make that much as a doctor.” Replied the plumber, “Neither did I when I was a doctor.”

A Hindu, a rabbi and a lawyer were driving through the rural areas when their car broke down. A nearby farmer said they could stay the night but he had only two spare beds, so one person must use the barn.
The Hindu agreed, but returned to the house moments later saying there was a cow in the barn and since cows were sacred, he could not possibly sleep there. The rabbi took his place but he fled, too, because there was a pig there and pigs were anathema to Jews. Finally, the lawyer said he would go.
Moments later there was a knock on the farmhouse door. It was the cow and the pig.
