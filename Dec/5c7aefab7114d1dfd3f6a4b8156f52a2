Covid-19 has created an opportunity to build back a more equal and sustainable world.The Covid-19 pandemic has shown that we are all in this togethe. The Covid-19 pandemic has tested societies across the globe and set back human rights gains and progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
In Kenya, the multi-faceted impacts of the pandemic – on gender equality, health, education, livelihoods, rule of law and the economy – have tested efforts by the government, United Nations and development partners to deliver on Vision 2030 and the Big 4 agenda.

The crisis has hit the poorest and most vulnerable communities the hardest, and entrenched existing inequalities, discrimination and human rights challenges.
Gender-based violence has skyrocketed; loss of employment and livelihoods have put further strain on families; the right to education is at risk for many children, particularly girls; and inequalities in access to water, adequate housing and health services have heightened vulnerabilities.

In this context, the theme of Human Rights Day 2020 is “Recover Better – Stand Up for Human Rights”, highlighting the need to build back better from the Covid-19 crisis by putting human rights at the heart of recovery efforts.
This is a call to action and for unity of purpose to tackle discrimination, address inequalities, encourage participation and solidarity, and promote sustainable development for the benefit of all.
As the United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, once remarked, “The pandemic has demonstrated the fragility of our world”.
The crisis has exposed and exacerbated deep inequalities, entrenched discrimination and gaps in human rights protection.
Recovery efforts
Only measures to close these gaps and advance human rights can ensure we fully recover and build back a world that is just and sustainable.

Covid-19 has created an opportunity to build back a more equal and sustainable world – based on a “new social contract” that respects the rights and freedoms of all, and addresses the inequalities exposed by the pandemic.
This “new social contract” – uniting governments, civil society and private sector – is the only way to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.
To deliver upon the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, it is imperative to prioritise participation and inclusion, to ensure we leave no one behind. Successful Covid-19 recovery efforts require the robust participation of civil society and inclusion of communities, to ensure the voices and priorities of the most affected, vulnerable and marginalised inform recovery efforts.
Public participation is a key tenet of the Constitution of Kenya, and has a key role to play in the Covid-19 recovery.
It is clear that this pandemic cannot be surmounted by a single actor. It is against this backdrop that the United Nations Country Team and the Government of Kenya, in line with the motto Umoja ni Nguvu (Unity is Strength), have identified strategic areas of cooperation and engagement under the United Nations Development Assistance Framework, as well as the Socio-Economic Response Plan, that target Covid-19 recovery needs and continue the trajectory towards the Sustainable Development Goals.

This is underpinned by a human rights-based approach that prioritises equality and non-discrimination, participation and inclusion, and accountability.
The Covid-19 pandemic has shown that we are all in this together – and solidarity is the only way forward.
