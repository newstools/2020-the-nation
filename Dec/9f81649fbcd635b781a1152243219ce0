Two bodies were Friday night found during a search and rescue operation after the historic House of Wonders in Zanzibar collapsed.

Constructed in 1883, the House of Wonders’ partial collapse is a huge blow to the Zanzibar’s’ tourism industry.
Beit Al Ajaib is the largest and tallest building in Zanzibar located at the world’s heritage site of Stone Town. It attracts tourists from all corners of the world and generates revenue for the government.
In the statement issued Saturday, the Zanzibar government sent condolences to the bereaved families of the two victims of the accident.





The statement also revealed that four workers sustained injuries following the collapse.
“The government promises to collaborate with the families in this difficult time of losing the beloved ones and urges all Zanzibaris and Tanzanians in general to remain calm,” the statement read.
