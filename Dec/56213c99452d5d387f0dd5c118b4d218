There has been relief and some measured elation in most of the world following announcements that a number of companies have developed efficacious vaccines against the coronavirus disease, otherwise known as Covid-19.

The challenge going forward will be to ensure that the vaccines are produced and distributed for administration, one would think. However, there are also emerging the realisation that the enthusiasm and elation over the vaccines is not a shared one.
There are persons worldwide who do not believe in and have flatly declared that they would not take the vaccine even if the vaccine were to be made available at no cost.

There is the thinking in some countries that the taking of the vaccines should be made legally mandatory owing to the overall public health challenge that the Covid-19 pandemic poses to the world. The opponents to vaccines cite many reasons and excuses as to efficacy and safety.
However, a number of them argue that administration of vaccines would not only offend their religious rights but also constitute invasion of their privacy and their respective rights to personal autonomy.
Obtaining a visa
This leaves open the question whether a law can mandate the taking of vaccinations and or any time of medication as a compulsory public health requirement. For purposes of international travel, some countries do mandate some vaccination as a condition for obtaining a visa or for gaining entry to their territories.

A number of countries in East Africa require the evidence of vaccination against yellow fever as a condition for granting entry to other East Africans.
But the issue gets more complex where the demand is for a citizen to be subjected to compulsory vaccination within the country of his nationality. As said before, some persons object to this on the ground that this constitutes an intrusion in to their private affairs that is health. In the United States, the main decision here is the Case of Jacobson against the State of Massachusetts.
This case arose after regulations passed in 1902 by the Board of Health of Cambridge, being of the opinion that it was necessary for the public health and safety, required the vaccination and revaccination of all the inhabitants of the state.
Anti-vax
This vaccination was compulsory but free. Pastor Jacobson refused to be vaccinated. He was charged with an offence, convicted and fined.
On appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, Jacobson argued that subjecting him to a fine or imprisonment for neglecting or refusing vaccination was an invasion of his liberty, the law was “unreasonable, arbitrary and oppressive”, and that one should not be subjected to the law if he or she objects to vaccination, no matter the reason.

Justice John Marshall Harlan said “in every well-ordered society charged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand” and that “real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own (liberty), whether in respect of his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be done to others.” Pastor Jacobson’s objection was dismissed and the court held that it was lawful and constitutional.
The court, however, acknowledged that in “extreme cases”, for certain individuals “in a particular condition of ... health”, the requirement of vaccination would be “cruel and inhuman(e)”, in which case, courts would be empowered to interfere in order to “prevent wrong and oppression by compulsory mandate for vaccination.
This is the portion of that Judgment that objectors to vaccination carry with them as basis for their objection to compulsory vaccination. Suffice that this statement is even used by other persons to decline all kinds of medical interventions that they consider contradictory of their faith or personal conscience. Examples include use of this as basis for refusal to take blood transfusions by some religious sects.

There is a paradox that although medical treatment is intended to improve the health and well-being of the patient, an adult and sane person may exercise the right to refuse medical treatment even though that refusal may seem unwise, foolish or ridiculous or may even be directly harmful to his health. This right is founded on the respect for the autonomy of the individual and the right to protect the integrity of his body. These rights are predicated on the fundamental rights of the individual in the constitutions of most states.
In Argentina for example, there is a law known as the Patient’s Rights Act, which permits a person do decline treatment. The Supreme Court has previously ruled on patients’ right to autonomy in a case in 1993 which dealt with a patients who needed blood transfusions but, declined to have it on account of religious objection. The patient was conscious when he refused the transfusion.

The judges held that the patient was entitled to refuse blood transfusion because human dignity is inviolable and that other values are instrumental compared to respect for persons. In another case, a patient was hospitalised in a critical condition while unconscious. He had previously signed a written oath where he declared his wish not to receive blood transfusions even under risk of death.

The Supreme Court upheld the patient’s choice and said that patients, when accepting or refusing a specific treatment, “have the right to make a choice according to their own values or points of view, even when it may seem irrational or imprudent, and that free choice must be respected.”
In India, the Supreme Court in the case of K.S Puttaswamy v Union of India also known as the Ardhar Case, held that the right to privacy is not absolute and may be curtailed as long as the procedure is fair, just and reasonable and as long as the proportional restrictions further a legitimate state aim.
Public good
Therefore , on account of public health, order, morality the right to practice religion may be subordinated to the larger public objective to contain and prevent disease and that there is sufficient constitutional leeway for the government to claim the power to enforce compulsory vaccination.
In Kenya, these same arguments may apply although there is a right to healthcare and adequate healthcare services. Mandated as rights and not obligations, there is doubt whether this could be used to empower the state to mandate mass vaccination on all citizens.
However, the Public Health Act requires every parent to ensure that every child is vaccinated against small pox. It also states that a child may not be admitted to a school if such child has not been vaccinated or does not show evidence of vaccination.

This, founded upon the state’s duty to facilitate the progressive enjoyment of economic and social rights by Kenyans , may well be an indication that could be read and used to mandate mass vaccination for all in response to a pandemic.
