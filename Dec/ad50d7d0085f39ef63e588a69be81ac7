Traders in Nairobi’s Industrial Area are counting their losses after an inferno, said to have been started by a street boy, razed down their structures on Thursday morning. 
The structures were located along Entreprise road and situated behind Industries. Property of unknown value was reduced to shell.

A trader at the area, Mr Benard Mulonzi, said the fire started in a nearby section which is used for disposal of plastics and tyres, before it spread to their structures. 
“The fire started from the yard where a street boy was burning tyres. It was fanned by strong wind,’’ Mr Mulonzi remarked. 
The incident happened when most of the owners had closed shop for the Christmas holiday with many of them having left for their rural homes. 
Mr Mulonzi added that he was lucky since his salon was not affected by the fire. 





The structures affected include a food kiosk, clothes shop and Jua Kali stores, among others. 
Fire fighters from the Nairobi County government responded in time and helped put out the inferno.
