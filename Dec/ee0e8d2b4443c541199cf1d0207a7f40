The school moved to the High Court and sought for the judgment to be set aside.According to court documents, the minor’s parent contended the school discriminated the child because of his HIV status. The High Court has overturned a Sh5 million award to a minor by a tribunal that had ruled that the boy had been denied admission to a school in Kajiado because of his HIV status.
On June 8, 2018, the HIV and AIDS Tribunal had ruled against Namarat Academy School, finding that the minor’s rights, protected under the HIV and AIDS Prevention and Control Act, had been violated by the institution.

But Justice E. C. Mwita, sitting in a Kajiado High Court, has ruled that the minor’s parent did not prove to the court that the school discriminated against the pupil due to his HIV status.
“From the totality of the circumstances of the case before the tribunal, the respondent failed to prove direct discrimination or sufficient conduct from the appellants for drawing an inference of discrimination,” Justice Mwita said in his judgment on December 18, 2020.

});
}, 62000);
}



Justice Mwita said it must be clear that in a claim for discrimination, a plaintiff is still required to prove direct discrimination or show that through the conduct of the defendant.
“I would have been prepared to agree with the tribunal that the minor was discriminated against, had the respondent shown that the 1st appellant’ s initial reaction was negative when she disclosed the minor’s health condition to him, and then took steps to prevent him from joining the school. That would probably have led to an inference that there was a discriminatory intent,” said the judge.
The HIV and Aids tribunal on June 8, 2018 had ruled that the minor had been discriminated by the school and awarded him Sh5 million.
Arguments
The school moved to the High Court and sought for the judgment to be set aside. Through their lawyer, the school argued that the tribunal was wrong in finding that the appellants discriminated against the minor on grounds of his health.

According to court documents, the minor’s parent contended the school discriminated the child because of his HIV status.
The boy’s mother said she went to the school to seek admission of their child in class seven. The child sat an interview on December 9, 2015 but he did not perform well and was asked to join class 6.
He was asked by the school to report on January 5, 2016 when schools opened. The school gave the parent school requirements, including the fee structure and uniform.
The parents were to bring the minor’s birth certificate and identification documents on the reporting day.
The parent also told the court that they informed the school about the minor’s health status and at the time said the management had no problem with it.
They asked the school to supply them with softcopies of the school requirements which were sent, but bank details were missing. They promised to pay the fees in four to five days. The parents told the court that they delayed taking the child to school because they had not paid fee.
However, the parents told the court when they enquired again on January 12, 2016 from the school, they were informed the class was full.

});
}, 62000);
}



The parent said they later learned that the school had admitted another child in the same class and had also declared two other vacancies.

});
}, 62000);
}



“Another pupil was given a vacancy in the same class, the minor had been denied an opportunity on grounds that the school was full,” the parent told the court.
The parent said she was prepared to take the child for admission on January 13, 2016 after paying school fees.
According to them, their child was denied admission after they disclosed to the school his HIV status.
On the contrary, the Namarat Academy School argued the minor failed to comply with the admission requirements, and although he attended an interview and was offered admission to class 6, he did not report to school on the date.
