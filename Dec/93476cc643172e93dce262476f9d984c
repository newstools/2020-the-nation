My gripe with Mwendwa is his ill-advised move to declare journalists from certain media houses persona non grata at football match venues.On this score, he has bitten more than he can chew. There was a time when the powers that be in Kenyan football treated journalists like lap dogs, adorable ‘pets’ at the beck and call of then federation boss, Sam Nyamweya.
Nyamweya, a man who is 'generous' to a fault, would liberally dish out pocket change to scribes at every press conference he called.

Little wonder his press conferences were always well-attended by journalists, quacks and any layabout in town who could find his way to the venue.
Those were the days when the federation chief was guaranteed unfettered media coverage, even for the most mundane activities.
For the peanuts they received, some journalists swore allegiance to their supreme benefactor. These fellows would savagely attack any of their kind who dared write a ‘negative’ story about Nyamweya.
'Experience'
I speak from experience having once run into big trouble sometime in July 2013 for penning an opinion on these pages calling out my unprofessional colleagues for their dalliance with Nyamweya at the expense of objective news coverage.





At the time, word had it that some computer geek had hacked into Nyamweya’s mobile money transfer account and was about to unleash the names of sports journalists on his payroll.
For obvious reasons, the rumour threw many newsrooms into panic. Apparently, many palms had been repeatedly greased by the federation boss.
Mercifully, for the many worried souls, the much-dreaded dossier didn’t materialise.
But even then, I took a lot of flak from my colleagues for my well-intended piece. I was branded a spoilsport. Some even went around saying that I was merely 'bitter' because I had been denied an opportunity to dip my fingers into the honey jar. Preposterous and laughable allegations!

Emboldened by the sway he held over sports journalists, Nyamweya would at times go overboard in his efforts to suppress ‘negative’ coverage. This he was able to do with the help of snitches who held brief for him in nearly all mainstream newsrooms.
There was one particularly hilarious incident late one evening when a certain sports sub editor, who was furiously banging away copy to beat the fast-approaching deadline, got an unexpected phone call from Nyamweya.
The federation boss wanted to know why the sub editor was hellbent on publishing a negative story about him. One of Nyamweya’s hatchet men in the newsrooms had leaked the following day's big story. Now he wanted to have the story killed.
Such was the working relationship between the federation and Kenyan journalists back then.
But times have changed. So too has the face and sound of the federation. The ‘good old days’ are far behind us. Long gone is the charitable Nyamweya, his place taken by the malevolent Nick Mwendwa.
Unlike Nyamweya, Mwendwa is not a man given to dolling journalists with freebies. Handouts at press conferences are thankfully now a thing of the past.
Let me state here that no Kenyan sports journalist worth his salt needs handouts from Mwendwa, or any sports administrator for that matter.

My gripe with Mwendwa is his ill-advised move to declare journalists from certain media houses persona non grata at football match venues. On this score, he has bitten more than he can chew.
