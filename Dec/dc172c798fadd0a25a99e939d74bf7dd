A section of MCAs walked out of the event in a protest against not being allocated seats but Speaker Moffat Teya convinced them to return.
In his address at the ceremony that hundreds of residents attended, Mr Teya asked Mr Nyaribo to unite the county.
"We ask you to be our unifying factor," he said. An interdenominational prayer service was held at Nyamira Primary School ahead of tomorrow’s burial.
