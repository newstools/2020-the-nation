A police officer has been arrested on the accusation of killing his civilian companion on Tuesday evening.
Via Twitter, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) identified the murder suspect as Edgar Mokamba, a police constable based at the Nyari patrol base in Gigiri.
“With an AK47 rifle, the officer had been deployed as a station guard moments before he was joined by his regular friend, who frequents the patrol base in Nairobi's Westlands area,” the DCI said.

“Shockingly, a blast of shots was heard hours later. The officer in charge of the base rushed to the scene only to find the lifeless body of the victim in the driver's seat of his Toyota Probox.”
The DCI said Mr Mokamba had been socially chewing miraa with the deceased.
“He was disarmed and arrested, having sprayed 10 rounds of ammunition in the blast.”
