"The worst Juventus of this first part of the season. I apologise to the fans in my name, first of all. There is nothing to add," defender Bonucci wrote on Instagram.
Ronaldo blasted "a far from acceptable result" as the Portuguese star failed to add to his Serie A-leading tally of 12 league goals so far.
"Yesterday, with a poor performance and a far from acceptable result we closed our scheduled games for 2020, a special year in many ways," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on Instagram.





"Empty stadiums, COVID protocols, postponed games, long stoppages and a very tight calendar.
"But this is no excuse for anything. We know that we have to give more of ourselves, in order to play better and to win in a more consistent way.
"We are Juventus! And we simply cannot accept anything less than excellence on the pitch!
"I hope this short stoppage may help us to come back stronger and more united than ever, because the season is still far from over and in the end we believe that we will, once again, celebrate with our fans.
"Believe in us, trust our team as much as we trust you, and we will deliver! Fino Alla Fine!"
The defeat came hours after the nine-time reigning Serie A champions learned they must play the match against Napoli which was cancelled on October 4 after the southerners decided not to travel to Turin because of coronavirus cases.
