On his return, Olunga had a few decent chances to improve on his tally of 26 goals, but could not beat South Korean goalkeeper Kim Jin-Hyeon. Olunga has now gone three matches without a goal, his longest goal drought in the league this season.
He played full 90 minutes against Cerezo in a match Kashiwa started with a decent record of two identical 3-0 wins at Yanmar Stadium Nagai.
Goals from Yuta Nakayama, Ataru Esaka and Cristiano were enough to hand Kashiwa victory over Cerezo in November 2018 in the league. Olunga was an unused substitute in that fixture.





Olunga was completely left out of the squad when Esaka grabbed a brace and Hiroto Goya netted once as Kashiwa tossed Cerezo out of the Levain Cup at quarter-final stage three months ago.
J1 League’s leading scorer Olunga netted the consolation goal when Kashiwa lost 3-1 in the league at Sankyo Frontier in August. 
Playmaker Ataru Esaka also returned to the starting line-up on Saturday. He was rested on 82 minutes for forward Hiroto Goya.
