Jubilee party is not fielding a candidate in the Msambweni by-election.DP William Ruto has however thrown his weight behind independent candidate Feisal Bader. President Uhuru Kenyatta has seemingly endorsed the candidature of ODM's Omar Boga in the Msambweni by-election slated for December 15.
On Thursday, Mr Boga met President Kenyatta and even accompanied the head of state, alongside Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, to the commissioning of Sh1.9 billion Likoni Floating Bridge in Mombasa.

The president even posed for photos with Boga. The gesture has been interpreted by some as the president's endorsement of Boga's candidature in the forthcoming by-election.
On social media, where the photos trended, some said the by-election has already been sealed.
Earlier in the day, Mr Boga left a party's meeting between Raila Odinga and grassroots leaders at Buffon hotel to go and meet the president.
Mr Boga briefly addressed the delegates before leaving for Mombasa to meet President Kenyatta.

"Sorry for breaking the protocol, I'm rushing to Mombasa to meet the President," he said.
Arranged meeting
A close ally of Mr Odinga told the Nation that the meeting between President Kenyatta and Mr Boga was arranged on phone by the ODM party leader.
"Our party leader made a phone call while we were holding a meeting and the President agreed to meet Mr Boga," the source told the Nation.
However, the details of the meeting between Mr Boga and Mr Kenyatta were scanty.
In September, the Jubilee party announced that it would not field a candidate for the Msambweni by-election citing the handshake between President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga.
The party decision has however been defied by Deputy President William Ruto who has thrown his weight behind independent candidate Feisal Bader.

The DP is expected to visit Msambweni on Saturday to drum up support for Mr Bader. Ex-senators who were campaigning for Independent candidate missing in action. Political showdown that was expected between Raila and Ruto toned down. He allegedly received a sh200,000 bribe to approve the opening of a fuel station in Oyugis. Kabila had succeeded in forming an army with many generals said to still be loyal to him. This is the first time Uhuru is meeting Abiy since Addis Ababa launched a crackdown on TPLF.
