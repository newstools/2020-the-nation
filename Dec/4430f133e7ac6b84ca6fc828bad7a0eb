Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka will communicate the decision of the Nairobi County Assembly to impeach Governor Mike Sonko when the House reconvenes for a special sitting today.
The Speaker has summoned a special sitting of the House after the MCAs impeached Sonko on Thursday last week.
The Speaker’s communication will kickstart the formal process of impeachment hearing for the governor, a process that must be concluded in the next 10 days, starting today.

On Tuesday, the top Committee of the Senate agreed that the governor be tried through the special committee, which will investigate and ensure that allegations levelled against him by the ward reps are substantiated.
Mr Sonko is facing allegations of gross violation of the Constitution and other laws, abuse of office and crimes under national law.





After the communication, the Senate Leader of Majority Samuel Poghisio will table the motion proposing the formation of the 11-member committee.
The County Governments Act provides that the governor should be tried either through the committee or the whole House.
If the lawmakers approve the motion, the committee will have 10 days to investigate the issue and report back to the House, detailing whether the County Assembly will have proved its case against the governor.
Governor Sonko’s spokesperson Ben Mulwa said they have already begun gathering evidence for their defence before the Senate.
“He is already meeting his lawyers to prepare his defence in Senate but we cannot rule out anything. The court is also an option,” said Mr Mulwa.
The County Assembly team has expressed confidence that they have a watertight case against the Governor and they will prove the same before the Senate.

Minority Leader and mover of the impeachment motion, Michael Ogada, said they are fully prepared to face senators with evidence to show why Sonko must go home.
“We are ready to face the Senate to prosecute our case and show why we sent Sonko home. We have evidence and we are confident that they will uphold our resolution,” said Mr Ogada.
Majority Leader Abdi Guyo echoed Mr Ogada’s sentiments, saying they have assembled a legal team led by lawyer Ndegwa Njiru to prosecute their case before the Senate.
“We are fully prepared and good to go to present our evidence before the Senate. We are 100 per cent sure that the Senate will agree with us and save Nairobi residents from an inefficient and incapable governor,” said Mr Guyo.
