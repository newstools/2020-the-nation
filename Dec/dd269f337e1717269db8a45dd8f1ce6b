The lorry was heading towards Sagana from Karatina while the car was travelling to Nyeri from Nairobi.
Witnesses said the lorry swerved before it hit the car, killing the two instantly.
"We saw the lorry cross over to the side of the small car before it crashed into it," one of the witnesses said.
The accident caused a major traffic snarl-up as residents and police blocked the usually busy Makutano-Nyeri road as they rescued the survivor who had been trapped in the small car.
