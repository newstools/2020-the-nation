The board held a crisis meeting on Friday as Mr Oimeke carried on with his duties at his desk.By evening, Mr Oimeke was still making calls to staff members to present the monthly pump prices’ statement for his signature, unaware that they had been instructed not to give the monthly statement to the embattled boss. By Monday evening, the renewable energy expert was still fighting to stay in office after spending a night in the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission cells. Mr Robert Pavel Oimeke’s reign at the helm of the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) was pretty much like a faulty jet’s take-off. 

Slow, then fast and off the ground, followed by a turbulent ride and a crash. His interdiction late on Monday was as dramatic as his August exit and return two months later from a court battle over the renewal of his three-year term.

By Monday evening, the renewable energy expert was still fighting to stay in office after spending a night in the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission cells, with reports indicating he had been caught red-handed receiving Sh200,000 from a petrol station attendant, according to the EACC. 

While many had expected Mr Oimeke to be arraigned on Monday after spending the weekend in custody, he was released on bond late on Friday. He had then returned to the office and was conducting his duties unperturbed. 






"We were shocked to see him in the office. We had not heard about him after the arrest on Thursday. There were a few people around as well; men dressed in suits and standing outside his office and that of the board chairman. That caused a lot of confusion," a senior manager who requested anonymity intimated. 

Crisis meeting 

The board held a crisis meeting on Friday as Mr Oimeke carried on with his duties at his desk. The board at one point moved the venue of the meeting from the third floor, where Oimeke's office is situated, to the ground floor, and later to the first floor. 

By evening, Mr Oimeke was still making calls to staff members to present the monthly pump prices’ statement for his signature, unaware that they had been instructed not to give the monthly statement to the embattled boss.

He left after 4.30 pm, as the pump prices were delayed till after 7pm, by which time a new appointee had been picked to replace him. 

While his first term began quietly – at the height of the 2017 political campaigns – with the exit of engineer Joseph Ng'ang'a (who quietly retired eight months before the expiry of his term in January 2017), his second did not. 

A second petition had been filed to block his second term in office, just weeks to the end of his first term in July. 

Accusations 

The petitioner, Mr Emmanuel Wanjala, accused Mr Oimeke of dragging Epra into massive irregular dealings, including installation of faulty meters and increased court cases against the authority by former employees – who were dismissed for pointing out wrongdoings or mismanagement of resources and abuse of office.  

Through his lawyer Henry Kurauka, the petitioner accused Mr Oimeke of abuse of office, mismanagement of a public institution and public resources, corruption, tribalism and favouritism and wanted his reappointment blocked for not being a member of a relevant professional body as clearly stipulated under section 13 (3) (e) of the Energy Act. 

The EACC had been enjoined in the case with a view to compelling the agency to investigate the claims, but the watchdog said in court that no complaints had been filed against Mr Oimeke before it.

In the earlier petition, which was withdrawn under unclear circumstances, the Epra boss had been accused of irregular issuance of licences and appointments that had failed to 'reflect the face of Kenya', with close to 80 per cent of his recruits allegedly hailing from one community. 

A court order issued by Justice Hellen Wasilwa to stop the regulator's board chaired by retired Supreme Court Judge Justice Jackton Ojwang' from renewing Oimeke’s term did not last long. 

Justice Wasilwa would later dismiss the case two months later for lack of evidence, paving the way for Mr Oimeke's return to EPRA where the Corporation Secretary /Director of Legal Affairs Mueni Mutung'a had been appointed to hold brief in his absence. 

Facebook claims deleted 

There was a social media post alleging his connection to powerful political figures who would ensure his return to the office. He, however, deleted the post and his Facebook account after the matter was reported by the Business Daily. 

His return only added to the fear among some staff and stakeholders who would rarely discuss Mr Oimeke, affectionately referred to as "mfalme (king)" by peers and "scorpion" by some industry players who at some point fell victim to his enforcement actions.

To his staff, he was the centre of power and information around the office was strictly guarded. Office computers had all USB ports disabled, making emails the only way to send documents and which could easily be tracked, or so they feared. 

Even the government agencies he regulated made indirect complaints about him, including increased approval of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) at a time the country was choking from excess generation of electricity and consumers were continuously paying for unused power. 

Kenya Power protested after Epra reportedly allowed some 34 PPAs over a short duration, deals that would inject about 1,891 Megawatts into the national grid in the next five years. 

The electricity distributor wrote to the parent ministry demanding that the energy regulator be removed from Power Purchase Agreement negotiations to reduce oversupply of electricity in the market.

"It is noteworthy that with the current slow growth in peak demand, the shifting of project Commercial Operations Dates (CODs) will not address the imminent oversupply challenges. Clearly, a different model is required that will deliver revenues for these projects and at the same time reduce retail tariffs as per Government policy," read the April 2020 letter sent to the ministry.

"One option is to create a separate entity dedicated to entering into PPAs with generators on behalf of the Government." 

On the spot 

Just before his first term ended in July, the regulator was on the spot after it emerged there had been an error in the fuel pump price calculation, leading to a huge jump in prices in August. 

The energy regulator had failed to correctly compute the prices for the June/July period, an error whose correction in the July/August fuel price caused a massive hike in pump prices. 

At the board, opinion was split regarding Mr Oimeke's performance, with his August suspension testing the unity of the 11-member team led by the retired Supreme Court judge. 

In fact, a board member even swore an affidavit in Mr Oimeke’s defence in court. Engineer Samuel Maugo told the judge that Oimeke had been rightfully appointed and confirmed by Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter in May 2020, long before the petition came up. 

The Monday board meetings are said to have been stormy and the discussions ended with the replacement of Mr Oimeke by his former intern at Epra, Mr Daniel Kiptoo, who had risen to be Petroleum Legal Advisor to the Cabinet Secretary. 

For the second time in less than three months, a new person was being appointed to act in Oimeke's absence.
