In 2012, as Deputy Prime Minister, Uhuru Kenyatta’s new political vehicle, The National Alliance (TNA) set for official launch, it quietly dropped a key plank in its founding charter: An Integrity code.
The requirements had been designed specifically to lock out disreputable characters, who were eyeing the party ticket for the impending General Election, such as then Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko and former Embakasi MP Ferdinand Waititu.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



The integrity code had been inserted into the party charter as Mr Kenyatta sought to project himself as the leader to bring a fresh approach to politics devoid of old hang-ups, ethnic loyalties and acceptance of corruption as a norm.
In much the same way, Mr Kenyatta had unsuccessfully sought to reshape the Kanu Party after controversially being handpicked by outgoing President Daniel arap Moi to carry the flag in 2002, he now hoped to market TNA as the cleaner, fresher successor to President Mwai Kibaki’s governing coalition.

});
}, 62000);
}



That the TNA integrity code was dropped without explanation was not surprising. To its credit, the code denied the likes of Sonko, Waititu and others facing criminal charges or general questions of ethical and moral probity opportunity to vie for elective seats on the party ticket. However, matters of realpolitik forced the party to rethink its lofty ideals. It needed the Sonkos and Waititus of this world to bring out the vote, and to capture the elective seats required to guarantee majorities in key assemblies.
Devolved government
More importantly, the party realised that locking out the likes of Sonko and Waititu on integrity grounds replicating those required Chapter 6 of the Constitution would also disqualify key party leaders, including Mr Kenyatta and his putative presidential election running-mate, United Republican Party (URP) leader William Ruto.

The integrity requirements were hastily dropped. That is how Kenya ended up with the Jubilee regime of President Kenyatta and Deputy President Ruto, and into the bargain, eventuality, the bonus of Governor Sonko in Nairobi County and Governor Waititu in Kiambu County. The former closed the year last week as the second governor to lose his seat on impeachment. The latter had preceded him into the dust heap with his own ejection from the lofty perch at the beginning of the year.
By finding ways to dance around the integrity requirements of leadership, Jubilee paved the way for the regime, whose spectacular failings have become all too evident even for the brain-dead who so lustily sang the ‘Uhu-Ruto’, ‘Muthamaki’ and ‘Tano Tena’ anthem. It also cursed our gubernatorial mansions with the likes of Sonko, Waititu and others whose leadership failures have seriously undermined the noble goal of devolved government.
A lot of water has passed under the bridge since. The Jubilee Party — formed on the merger of Kenyatta’s TNA and Ruto’s URP — is no more. It exists as a governing party in name only following unofficial divorce of the two key partners, President Kenyatta and his Deputy Ruto. The President has ditched his deputy and teamed up with ODM leader Raila Odinga to drive the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) that should culminate in a constitutional amendment referendum early next year. Among the key planks of the BBI is the promise to ramp up the war against corruption and also ensure adherence to the leadership integrity code enshrined in both the Constitution and the Laws of Kenya.

Loot the national coffers
Unfortunately, the integrity code has thus far been observed only in the breach. There is little to show that the changes proposed under BBI will offer anything more than lip service to the most urgent need to eradicate the cancer from our midst.
President Kenyatta has had more than enough opportunity under existing laws to strike mortal blows against corruption, but has looked on helplessly even as his own relatives, close friends and political associates loot the national coffers in a manner that rivals the worst excesses of the Moi kleptocracy.
One big achievement of BBI has been to drag Mr Odinga into the murk, and silence what was previously one of the most powerful voices against institutionalised graft and general misrule. The by-election to fill the vacant seat of Nairobi Governor presents the ‘cityzens’ a grand opportunity to assess both the Uhu-Raila and Ruto groupings.
 The measure will be on which of them fronts an upright, competent, incorruptible candidate; and which the usual crooked and sleazy city politico.
