Kiswahili is gaining much recognition worldwide.South Africa introduced it in schools early last year. In his article, “Kiswahili in PhD writing ‘tricky’” (DN, Dec. 29, 2020), Solomon Lumasia’s major point was that the main language of instruction in our education system is English, and, consequently, most people were much at ease transacting their business, specifically writing, in it.
He further opined that English is globally accepted and, hence, any deviation would make one a pariah.

});

}



Not entirely. Whereas English is the language of instruction in our learning institutions, the same cannot be said of its employment in our general day-to-day transactions.
Kiswahili is dominant and, as such, we naturally acquire it from our environment. But we fall short of a standard dialect. Regardless, we don’t have to use Kiswahili as a language of instruction in order to grasp it, much less write in it.
But its acceptability is debatable. Whereas writing in a ‘global’ language enhances chances of dissemination and possible uptake of research work, nothing stops the scholars from writing their reports in Kiswahili and translate them into other languages. 





Most researches inquire into local problems. It would be fair that they be rendered in the national language as well, so that as many citizens as possible access them. After all, many countries – including the Commonwealth, which he alluded to — use other languages.
India’s official languages, for instance, are Hindi and English, yet it conducts school instruction in varied languages. 
Local scholars in Kiswahili studies have since resorted to doing their theses in the language. The first PhD dissertation in Kiswahili was by Prof Abel Gregory Gibbe at Moi University in 1996.

However, whereas universities use Kiswahili as the language of instruction in its studies, they are largely beholden to linguistics books written in English. 
Kiswahili is gaining much recognition worldwide. South Africa introduced it in schools early last year.
With over 100 million speakers in Africa, and being one of the official languages of the AU, ignore it at your peril. We can easily excel in the language.
