Voting in the Msambweni by-election was today (Tuesday) conducted under a new reality — the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) armed its officials with thermoguns which they used to take temperatures of voters before allowing them into polling stations.
The officials also had with them sanitisers to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



A spot check by Nation revealed that in all the voting centres, IEBC had placed water points where voters washed their hands before voting.
At Mwakigwena and Jogoo Grounds polling stations, voters could be seen washing their hands before accessing their voting booths.
Before getting into the voting rooms, the voters had their temperatures taken by the polling officials.
No social distancing
However, social distancing was hardly observed in a majority of the polling stations.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("desktop-article-ad-1");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



IEBC went a step further in having some of the polling stations located in open-air grounds.
Returning Officer Yusuf Abubakar urged voters to wear masks and observe social distancing.
Speaking to the Nation, Mr Abubakar said the by-election will not be affected by the curfew hours, saying vote-counting would go on late into the night after polling is closed this evening.
ODM candidate Omar Boga, who voted at Jogoo Grounds, praised IEBC for ensuring that the exercise is done under strict Covid-19 protocols.
He, however, raised concern that a number of voters were not putting on masks and urged them to do so.
"In terms of the Covid-19 protocols, IEBC has done well. They have installed running water points, sanitisers and they are also using thermoguns to take the temperature of voters. This is commendable," said Mr Boga.

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



Mr Boga, who once tested positive for the virus, urged voters to observe the Covid-19 protocols.
He also attributed the low turnout of voters to fear of contracting the coronavirus.
