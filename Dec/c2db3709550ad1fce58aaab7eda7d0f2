In the last decade, we have witnessed PhDs across the disciplines being awarded on the basis of publication.A single-authored paper in international peer-reviewed journals is evidence of this experience Writing a thesis is the last task that a PhD candidate performs before being awarded the degree. Universities in the past centuries encouraged a system where papers are written only after a PhD thesis is done.
The embargo is then placed on the thesis and only the title, abstract, and citation information is released to the public. The full text is hidden from the public for a period of time. The rules governing the embargoes varies from one university to another.

In the last decade, we have witnessed PhDs across the disciplines being awarded on the basis of publication. This process involves writing a series of papers and submitting them to an international peer-reviewed journal during the doctorate candidature. The published articles are then turned into a thesis for the award of PhD.
The minimum number of publications that may lead to the award of PhD by publication is an open question. However, the candidate must certify, among other criteria: publish a single-authored paper and at least one more paper published with the supervisor. This model of the PhD serves the following: Firstly, the job market requires researchers with prior publishing experience.





Takes away stress
A single-authored paper in international peer-reviewed journals is evidence of this experience. Secondly, co-authorship with a supervisor, is a clear demonstration of the mentorship programme and a sign of confidence amongst the scholars. Thirdly, the publications contribute immensely to institutional research performance and international ranking.
Notice that if several papers are published in peer-reviewed journals, the PhD candidate gets helpful feedback on his scholarly work before submission of the thesis. This increases chances for acceptance of the PhD thesis and hence takes away stress and anxiety from the candidate. Generally, the PhD by publications enhances the quantity and quality of scientific work.

 Articles published in internationally reviewed journals are an important aspect of research jobs, grants, and post-doctoral fellowships. While we can state many of these benefits from PhD by publications, we do not have sufficient data to justify the impact of this kind of researchers compared to those who are awarded a PhD without a single publication.
This idea, therefore, invites the scholarly community at large to have this conversation on the diversity of doctorates and how they will influence the market trends.
The critics of PhD by publication argue that both the supervisor and the institution have relinquished their responsibility to journals to maintain standards and improve the PhD work. The examination of a thesis based on papers is biased since the scores are based on where the articles were published rather than the work itself.
English and Kiswahili
This requires developing a new set of policies to guide on assessment or examining the new model of the thesis. It’s also time PhDs were written in both English and Kiswahili. The move will create a greater impact on society as the outcome of the thesis is spread to the general public. This will also accelerate the growth of the Kiswahili language in research and in scientific writings.

In conclusion, PhD by publication has more advantages compared to the old system of getting a PhD first then publish later.
