A Special Stage (SS) is a section of closed road at a stage rallying event. Racers attempt to complete the stage in the shortest time. A race on a special stage is co-ordinated such that each competing racer begins after a set interval, to reduce the chance of impedance by other competitors.
Each SS is a relatively short section, usually up to about 40 kilometres in length. A rally usually comprises approximately 15 to 30 special stages. The driver with the lowest overall time for all special stages in an event is the winner.

Rally cars also run upgraded engine valves to allow more fuel in and exhaust gasses out. This makes for bigger bangs in the engine.
Bigger bangs make more noise.
The compression ratios are also higher than in a standard road car and the engines are designed to rev higher than that of an average road car.
