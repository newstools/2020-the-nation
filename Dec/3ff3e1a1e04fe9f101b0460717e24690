This time around, BBI seems a pre-emptive deal aimed at power sharing post-2022 General Election. Following the proceedings of the Building Bridges Initiative, one thing coming out is that it is an ODM-led campaign. They have immersed themselves in pursuit of the ‘handshake’ benefits with gusto.
The term ‘crying louder than the bereaved comes to mind’ as ODM remains right in the heart of the BBI campaigns than even Jubilee Party, who co-own the handshake. As incumbents, Jubilee Party should be singing the loudest on BBI and handshake but for some peculiar reasons, it is measured and divided.

ODM’s support of the BBI throws up the idea of nusu mkate once more. This time around, BBI seems a pre-emptive deal aimed at power sharing post-2022 General Election. Which makes the ‘handshake even more suspicious. It’s the worst idea ever mooted if its intention is to create another nusu mkate government.

 Forget the notion that it is meant to unite the country. How that could be possible when ODM has put a knife in the middle of Jubilee Party and twisted it to divide its key alma maters President Kenyatta and VP Ruto? The division in the party has created a domino effect in the country and the citizens are split down the middle too as a result of the departure from handshake ‘unity’ and fall out from the BBI.
Focus on statesmanship
There is no one whose credibility hangs in the balance as a result of the fall out on BBI than former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. He risks turning into the emperor with no clothes as his party totters around him instead of advising him that perhaps the time is right for him to scale back on political ambitions and focus more on statesmanship, lest his star wanes further.
This is not the first time Mr Odinga has tried to siphon a position within the government through backroom deals. He somehow remains relevant within the governments formed since 2002 as he has become clever at finding a wriggle room to retain power. Understandably, every election he has been involved in has ended in a farce with claims of rigging and violence but somehow, he has always come out unscathed unlike his supporters as he shelters in whichever government is in place.

This time around, I believe his push for BBI to pave way for another post for him in government come 2022 is bound to paint him in terrible light. If I were his disciple, I would advise him to leave while still on top.
His silence on unsavoury means being employed, such as use of public officials and State resources to gather signatures for the BBI referendum and his insensitivity towards the impact of Covid-19 on the population and slowing down economy only shows how far he is prepared to go to regain power.
Mr Odinga does not need to stoop so low to rely on BBI to keep him relevant in the political scene. He has nothing more to prove. He must walk away now with head held high while we still remember him as one of the key architects of democracy in Kenya if not Africa.

His sacrifices as he pushed against the single party State will be etched in the history of Kenya for posterity. The 2010 Constitution that we are now proud of could not have been realised without his sacrifice, in-put and resolve. He remains one of the heroes of what came to be known as the 2nd Liberation of Kenya.
The current Constitution recently celebrated its 10th year. It has not hit puberty yet let alone being considered a fully grown and sickly adult requiring treatment. He is now leading a brigade through BBI to reverse all the democratic gains he singularly brought to the country.

Tension and uncertainties
We take cognisance of the fact that he will never get back the many years he lost in jail as he fought for democracy. We salute him for his resilience. However, neither would he be able to recover his credibility both locally and internationally should he carry own tearing apart a country he helped to free from impunity.
The U-turn by Mr Odinga witnessed after the disputed 2017 presidential election left many aghast. The handshake came on the back of tension and uncertainties in the country.
The initial reason given for the handshake was to unite the country but that is now lost in acerbic wrestle for power for 2022 with Mr Odinga bang in the middle of it – again! The truth behind the handshake and BBI is getting economical by the day and with it chipping little layers of credibility from the former Prime Minister day by day.
As Kenny Rogers sang, Raila needs to know when to walk away and when to run. The time is now for him to look back at the success he made of bringing democracy to the country and bask in that glory rather than muddy the waters for himself in his winter years. He risks ending up in the lions’ lair like biblical David rather than the Canaan of his dreams.
