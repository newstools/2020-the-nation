"Nyagah had many friends and we are expecting 1,000 people to turn out to give him a send-off. Mourners who will not have face masks will be locked out. We don't want any other person to die from Covid-19," his brother Norman Nyagah told journalists at his rural home today. 

Burial rites 

His family has also revealed that his body will be handled using specific burial rites that the veteran politician had insisted on. 

For instance, the former Co-operatives Minister will be buried with his head facing the Mbeere hills, where locals sought refuge in times of war in the past, his younger brother said.

});
}, 62000);

He will also be laid to rest next to his grandfather, Nthiga Mwonge, who passed away many years ago at the age of 85. 

There will also be no viewing of the body. 

Mr Nyagah’s body will also not be dressed in new clothes, but in old ones which will be ironed by his elder son, Mr Jeremiah John Mwaniki. 

"My brother had expressed his wish to be buried in that manner and we must obey the instructions he gave us prior to his death," said Norman. 

Norman recalled that his brother had indicated that he should be buried at the family graveyard where other members of the family have been laid to rest. 

"Joe was categorical on where and how he should be buried. When he was alive he bought his clothes and ironed them himself. He gave us firm instructions that no one should buy him new clothes for him to wear when he dies. He believed in doing things for himself," he said.

Mr Nyagah was named after his grandfather and he loved him so much and when he was alive, he told family members that he would be buried next to him when he dies. The family is keen to follow these wishes on Saturday. 

Covid destroyed his body 

Mr Nyagah died of the Covid-19 disease, Norman, who is also the family's spokesperson, confirmed. 

Norman said Nyagah succumbed after being in intensive care at the Nairobi Hospital for one-and-a-half weeks. 

"It is no longer a secret my brother succumbed to Covid-19 complications," he said.He says his brother was admitted to the hospital on November 17 after he fell sick. He was treated for the disease, but the virus had destroyed 97 per cent of his lungs and he could not have survived. 

"The disease had extensively damaged Joe’s lungs and that is what caused his death," he says. 

Watched him die 

Norman narrated that Joe passed on as he watched after having a conversation with him for two hours. 

"My brother had just finished telling me how he should be buried when he breathed his last," he explains. 

However, he said that Nyagah lived a long life and that the family and the entire nation should be celebrating his life.
