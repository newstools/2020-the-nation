When President Uhuru Kenyatta takes to the podium for his eighth Jamhuri Day speech on Saturday, he will recap the Jubilee administration’s achievements – amid challenges – since he took power in 2013.

No doubt, Kenyans are better off today than they were on December 12, 1964 when the country became a republic.
Fifty-six years later, there have been triumphs, failures and missed chances.
Jubilee came to power  on a promise of a resurgent economy but the country is facing a recession, partly blamed on the Covid-19 pandemic.
Runaway national debt, a weakening shilling, public health crisis, rising levels of poverty, obsession with political machinations and uncertainty in education show a party and individuals that were not prepared to govern the country.





The shilling is trading against the dollar at Sh111 to Sh118.
The weakening of the currency means importers now pay more for goods.
Debt level
Debt stood at Sh1.8 trillion.
The debt accumulated by the country in less than eight years has surpassed what Kenya borrowed from 1963 to 2012.
When Mr Kenyatta became President, the country’s debt stood at Sh1.8 trillion. By June this year, it was Sh6.7 trillion.
The shilling has weakened by more than 7.4 per cent against the dollar, having opened 2020 at 101.34 and is now at 108.83.
It means the interest on the country’s loans is also going up.
The country’s health sector is in a crisis, with workers on strike as hospitals continue receiving Covid-19 patients amid rising infections and deaths.

Nurses and clinical officers at public hospitals boycotted duty early this week to press for higher pay and better working conditions.
The President has kept his political boat going as the country gears up for elections in 2022.
But his juggling skills will be tested to the limits as he drums up support for the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), a process meant to change parts of the country’s Constitution.
The BBI has faced opposition from many quarters. The President is expected to implore Kenyans to pass it at the referendum slated for next year.
Many challenges
Senate Majority Whip Irungu Kang’ata, an ally of the President in the ruling Jubilee party, admits that have been many challenges.
“Jubilee has delivered on many of its promises. The economy has grown at an average of six per cent and the middle class has expanded,” the Murang’a senator told the Saturday Nation.
“Expectant women are delivering free of charge at government hospitals, and the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) cover has been expanded. Transition rate has increased in education due to free day schooling.”
Mr Kang’ata added that cyclical ethnic conflicts during presidential elections have affected the country’s growth trajectory.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {

});
}, 62000);

He said the BBI is an attempt to remedy problems of nationhood and politics.

Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen says Jubilee’s first term will be remembered for public service but the second term has been characterised by infighting.
“Jubilee did a lot in education and health from 2013 to 2017. At the beginning of its second term, the government came up with the Big Four Agenda, which was going to be a culmination of its strategy after 10 years,” Mr Murkomen told the Saturday Nation. 
Infrastructure
“Unfortunately, the ruling party has wasted the second term on wrangles and infighting. It is s a paradox because the fights are around a project disguised as building Bridges. In the end, the quest for unity has become the greatest cause of wrangles in the government and Jubilee thus undermining public service.”
Prof Macharia Munene of the United States International University-Africa says it is still early to judge President Kenyatta and his administration.
“They have one and half years to go. They have done well in some areas like infrastructure and done poorly in others like health, though they may blame the Covid-19 pandemic. Passing a judgement is premature,” he said.
Meanwhile, technology giant Google will mark today’s Jamhuri Day with a doodle appearing on its search service homepage.

Those googling from Kenya today will be treated to an animated image with the country’s flag at the centre.
“The animated doodle of the Kenyan flag commemorates the freedom fighters who sacrificed and liberated the country from British colonialists,” Google said in a statement.
