Personality politics and revolt to interference from Mombasa leadership are not only major but also the underlying factors in this region dominated by the Digo, the Duruma and the ‘immigrant’ Kamba community.For the 20 years he served as an MP, Rai believed that the easiest candidate to beat was whosoever associates his race with Mombasa. Philip Mbaji: In Msambweni, it was about Kwale ‘against Mombasa’
The Msambweni by-election is done and dusted. Many feign surprise and read too much into the issue, according to their own leaning. In this atmosphere, different opinions have been advanced without consideration of the past.
History is stubborn and only armed with that analysis can we unveil the truth about South Coast politics. The not-so-independent candidate Feisal Bader beat the heavy favourite, ODM’s Omar Boga, but this is not the first time such upsets have occurred in Kwale.

The county has been consistent in registering inconsistent poll results for decades. Having been a teacher and a correspondent for one of the leading dailies based in region for a decade before pursuing other interests, Feisal’s victory, backed by Governor Salim Mvurya, against Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho’s Boga, did not surprise me.





Personality politics and revolt to interference from Mombasa leadership are not only major but also the underlying factors in this region dominated by the Digo, the Duruma and the ‘immigrant’ Kamba community. In 1997, a high school teacher, Marere wa Mwachai, pulled a surprise to become the first Mijikenda woman elected to Parliament owing to her sterling academic credentials against her main competitor, Kassim Mwamzandi.
In 2002, while President Mwai Kibaki’s Narc swept everywhere, Gonzi Rai made it in Kinango on a Ford-People ticket, leaving Narc’s LDP wing in Matuga and Msambweni through Chirau Ali Mwakwere and Juma Abdallah Ngozi.
 Shirikisho Party
Rai retained his seat on the same ticket in 2007, but Mwakwere won on a Shirikisho Party, leaving ODM in Msambweni to Omar Zonga, who had beaten Ngozi. Mwakwere lost his seat to the petitioner, Hassan Mwanyoha, in 2010, and in the ensuing by-election, with support of the then-Kisauni MP Hassan Joho, a storm brewed in Matuga. Mwakwere recaptured his seat on the then not popular Party of National Unity (PNU). The campaign had been very tough and Mwakwere was rattled till he allegedly got involved in hate speech. This got him to court but the charges were dropped.

Using the shark, Shirikisho Party symbol, Mwakwere nicknamed himself Dzipapa (the shark) creating a niche for himself becoming a strong political personality at the Coast at the time.
Both Mwakwere and Rai had all along been strongly opposed to interference from Mombasa leadership, a belief that saw the Kinango MP decamp and successfully defend his seat on Jubilee’s The National Alliance wing in 2013.
Ditch ODM
For the 20 years he served as an MP, Rai believed that the easiest candidate to beat was whosoever associates his race with Mombasa. It is the same belief that saw Mvurya ditch ODM for Jubilee in the run-up to the 2017 General Election.
 ODM’s presence was in Msambweni via Suleiman Dori and Mwanyoha in 2013 as long serving Ford-K councillor Khatib Mwashetani became the MP for newly created Lunga Lunga Constituency on the Moses Wetangula-led party.   In 2017, Mvurya and Mwashetani sailed through via Jubilee, Kassim Sawa Tandaza becoming Matuga MP on an ANC ticket while ODM had Benjamin Tayari (Kinango), Dori (Msambweni), Woman Rep Zuleikha Hassan and Senator Issa Boy.





With a well-structured bursary and the first overseas scholarship programme ever witnessed in Coast since independence, Mvurya has become a strong political personality in Kwale to the extent that “his word is final”.
