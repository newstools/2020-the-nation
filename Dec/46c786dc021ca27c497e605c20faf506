Kabuchai is the home of Ford-Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula, Bungoma Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga and Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati. 
Pundits have observed that the Ford-Kenya party is set to face serious test in the upcoming by-election, given unresolved leadership wrangles within the party.

Attempted coup
The party, which is the second-oldest democratic party in the country after Kanu, faced an attempted coup in May. 
The death of Kabuchai MP James Lusweti has set the stage for the Wetang’ula team and coup plotters to showcase their popularity. 





Pundits have observed that the Kabuchai by-election will be interesting to watch as it will show who controls the party.

Biggest test
The Kabuchai scenario presents the biggest test for Ford-Kenya and the greatest challenge to Wetang’ula, for whom victory would send a strong message that he is still in charge of the party.
Isaack Wanjekeche, a political analyst, says that the national attention the Kabuchai race will attract the interest of many players including Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga.
"Another test that Ford Kenya party is likely to face is the nominee will need a party certificate signed by both the party leader and the Secretary-General who at the moment are not in good terms with each other, " said Wanjekeche.

Legally, this would be Wetang’ula and David Eseli as party leader and secretary-general, respectively.
"Considering internal party wrangles between the two camps, it’s unlikely that either party would endorse a candidate they do not prefer. That will likely create issues in both camps," he said.
This comes even as DP Ruto and elders from Bamutilu clan met on Monday and endorsed Kakai to run as an independent candidate for the Kabuchai seat.
