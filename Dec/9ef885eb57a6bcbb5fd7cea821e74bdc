In March of the 1999 season, KFF decided to promote Mathare United at the expense of Red Berets. The Forces side appealed and the federation readmitted them before eventually deciding to also retain Mathare in the top league.Several matches were abandoned without being resolved. But the saga surrounding Mumias Sugar stole the show. This is not the first time in this column that I am quoting Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. The influential 19th century German philosopher is attributed for saying: “We learn from history that we do not learn from history.”
I have written about football administrators seeking leadership positions campaigning on the platform of change, gaining the federation top seat only to revert to the same old, same old modus operandi that had brought the local game down to its knees.

I talked about Maina Kariuki, Alfred Sambu, Sam Nyamweya, Nick Mwendwa. All promised a new beginning that never was. I love reading history, and I will once again flashback to the past to illustrate Hegel’s assumption made almost 200 years ago.
But first a look at, well, history.
The oldest professional football league competition in the world is the Football League that consists of 72 professional association football clubs, 69 in England and three in Wales.





The Football League was founded in 1888 and originally consisted of 12 clubs.
It is from this Football League that top clubs broke away from driven by a desire to develop further.
These clubs signed the Founder Members Agreement, establishing the basic principles for the setting up of the now famous Premier League that would have commercial independence from the Football League and the English Football Association, leaving it free to organise its own broadcast and sponsorship agreement.
And the rest, as they say, is history. Many other top leagues around the world have modelled their operations similar to the English Premier League.
Now back to our Kenyan situation. From the late 1990s to early 2000s the Kenya Football Federation-run premier league had become so chaotic, with haphazard fixtures, arbitrary decisions, illogical demotions and promotions, and general financial and management malfeasance from the federation that clubs simply got fed up.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



In 1998, when multiple title winners AFC Leopards won their last league trophy, Mumias were suspended from the competition and matches involving them awarded to their opponents. The federation later reinstated the sugar millers and cancelled the awarded matches.
KFF relegated three teams Green Berets, Mafuko Bombers and Reli and promoted Brooke Bond, KCB, Red Berets, Coastal Stars and Kisumu All Stars to increase the league from 18 teams to 20 for the 1999.
Later in the season the federation without any rational decided that the league would be reduced to 18 clubs again in 2000. However, 21 teams took part. This is how.
In March of the 1999 season, KFF decided to promote Mathare United at the expense of Red Berets. The Forces side appealed and the federation readmitted them before eventually deciding to also retain Mathare in the top league.
Several matches were abandoned without being resolved. But the saga surrounding Mumias Sugar stole the show.
The club, needing to win by seven clear goals in their final league fixture to clinch the title, thrashed Kisumu All Stars 10-0 to pip Tusker to the Kenyan championship on goal difference. Mumias and All Stars were found guilty of match mixing and suspended for one year.

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



But the decision to kick out Mumias was inexplicably overturned by FKF and the sugar side participated in the 2000 season.
That season started with FKF intent on reducing the league from a 24 to 16-club affair for the 2002 competition – 11 relegated and three promoted! At some point mid-season Kimbo and Utawala were added. Eventually the federation settled on 20 teams without any plausible explanation.
Eight weeks into the new season the federation decided to readmit relegated Kisumu Telekom and Brooke Bond.
Meanwhile Re-Union, relegated from top flight football, won a case in the High Court and were readmitted. Later, Mathare United and KCB demanded the dissolution of the league organisers, KFF, after the federation awarded their contested matches to Oserian under dubious circumstances.
Things came to a head in 2003. First, reigning champions Oserian Fastac were suspended from the league for failing to honour three consecutive matches. Then Kisima Bombers withdrew due to financial constraints even as KFF continued to include them in the fixtures. Brooke Bond also withdrew over financial challenges.
But the big news of that season was seven clubs from the eight that had qualified for the KFF mini league refusing to play demanding accountability from KFF. The clubs formed a loose alliance called Group of Seven to fight for their rights.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-4");
});
}



This group transformed to the Inter-Club Consultative Group (ICCG) that vigorously agitated for transparency from a corrupt and mismanaged KFF. They even threatened to withdraw from the federation.
The ICCG later converted to the Kenyan Premier Football Group (KPFG) that evolved into the Kenyan Premier League (KPL) that brought an admirable and desirable level of professional management of the league until 2020.
The federation eventually got back control of the league this season and it is obvious that history is again repeating itself to the detriment of our game.
Two clubs have been expelled from the league for rightfully demanding disclosure on a league broadcast rights deal unilaterally signed by the FKF president.

googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-3']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



Two others face a similar fate.
Fixtures are manipulated and rescheduled at the whim of the federation, clubs are given financial incentives depending on how they play to the tune of the federation president. Yap. The federation is fully running the Kenyan premier league.
What a change. Back to the rocky old.
