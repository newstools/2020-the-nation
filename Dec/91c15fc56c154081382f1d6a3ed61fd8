Protests
The incident that allegedly happened at one of the school's dormitory bathrooms sparked protests from irate students who walked over six kilometres to Webuye police station.
Bungoma residents and local leaders have also come out to condemn the alleged incident.
Bungoma County Woman Rep Catherine Wambilianga said it was quite unfortunate, adding that it should be speedily investigated.

“I want to express my concerns and condemn with utmost clarity the defilement of the minor. It is the right of every child to access quality education and be protected at all costs by the authorities in whose care the parents have bestowed responsibility,” she said.
“It is a school that we are proud of and therefore, we must guard the good culture and the safety of the girls, teachers and employees at all times,” she added.
