This is contained in a four-year strategic plan, meant to upgrade the hospital into a Level Six facility, which was unveiled by Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi on Tuesday.
Under the plan, the hospital will be transformed into a referral only facility, offering specialised services such as cancer treatment, intensive care services, dialysis and imaging among others.
Earlier, Governor Murungi said the county needs about Sh6 billion for infrastructure development for the hospital to attain the Level Six status.

“This plan is part of the Meru Vision 2040 which envisions Meru County as a regional hub for medical care. We want to have high quality medical facilities offering specialised treatment for conditions that are currently treated abroad. I will soon be unveiling a new hospital board led by Prof Jotham Micheni to implement this plan,” Mr Murungi said.
Health budget
He said his administration is spending over 30 per cent of its budget on health, adding that the establishment of a renal unit, ICU and an oncology unit as well as the ongoing construction of a 300-bed ward will help in offering better services.
The governor said Level Four hospitals in Meru are also being upgraded to prepare for phasing out of walk-in patients at the referral facility.

Mr Kiraitu said his administration is in the process of putting up a Sh1.6 billion cancer centre that will offer both diagnosis and treatment services.
Currently, the hospital has a bed capacity of 338 against an average inpatient occupancy of 450.
The hospital collects more than Sh413.5 million annually and intends to increase the collection by Sh100 million in five years.
Among the services targeted for boosting revenue include establishment of hearse services, a private inpatient wing and a doctors’ plaza, among others. The hospital also intends to adopt the use of clean energy to cut costs.
