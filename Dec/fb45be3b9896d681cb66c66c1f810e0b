"We have been operating in Kenya for three years now and we are pleased to be able to show solidarity with the Kenyan people and provide support for communities especially during this time when the pandemic has made it more difficult," he explained.
Mozzartbet has in the recent past also invested in water projects and healthcare.
On the sporting arena, it also sponsored Kenyan Premier League side Mathare United and gave uniforms and footballs to teams at the grassroots.





Grassroots empowerment
"The football talents available in this country are immense. We have been concentrating on empowering those at the grassroots by trying to help the youth become professional footballers," Mr Ochieng said.
He also announced that the firm will soon sink more boreholes in the informal settlements within Nairobi.
"We recently launched our first water project in Homa Bay. Through this initiative, Mozzartbet aims to give back to society by delivering clean water to the communities," he said.
"To support the healthcare facilities, we have invested Sh10 million worth of medical equipment to help fight Covid-19 in Kenya," added Mr Ochieng.
Healthcare facilities in Nakuru, Siaya, Kisii, Embu, Nyandarua, Baringo, Bomet, Kisumu, Kakamega and Kitui have benefitted from this programme.
