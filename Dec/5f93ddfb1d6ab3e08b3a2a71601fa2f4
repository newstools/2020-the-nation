A year ago, the first case of Covid-19 was reported in Wuhan, China. Sooner, the novel coronavirus seeped into every corner of the globe. As of this writing, over 1.6 million people have died, while more than 71 million have been infected.
Interestingly, the pandemic’s first anniversary coincides with the announcement of several vaccine candidates that have proved to be effective against the virus. Countries are now expected to embark on plans to procure and deliver the vaccines to protect their citizens through mass immunization campaigns. Vaccines have been heralded as one of the exciting and most cost-effective developments in public health.

 The public health system is replete with success stories realised by vaccines. First, smallpox was eradicated in 1980. Recently, polio was wiped out of Africa, though it remains endemic in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The transmission of many other infectious diseases has fallen sharply, as a result of routine immunisation.





However, despite the benefits associated with vaccines, some quarters have been expressing concerns about their effectiveness and safety, leading to hesitancy.
The key reasons for vaccine refusal stem from medical, religious, political, cultural and philosophical viewpoints. The prevailing argument is that vaccines are made up of toxic components that could cause more harm than the disease they are intended to contain. These sentiments and many other false conspiracy theories are amplified by anti-vaxxers in various platforms, undermining confidence in immunisation programmes.
Cost-benefit analysis
In light of these sentiments, public health and medical practitioners face an uphill task to shift minds and attitudes among those who hold doubts about vaccines. Top on the list of trusted advocates for vaccination campaigns should be healthcare professionals who, for instance, should be prioritised for vaccination against Covd-19. Indicating that healthcare workers are willing to be vaccinated would help increase immunization acceptance.

This would not only influence residents to take-up vaccines, but also, importantly, cover hard-to-reach pockets of a population.
