Growing capsicums
What are the ecological requirements of capsicum and how should I take care of them? Also, does the crop have a ready market?
Bernice
Capsicum production is popular, with most farmers growing green and red varieties. However, there is a shortage of yellow capsicums as their demand surpasses supply.

Yellow capsicums are in big demand in hotels and supermarkets and they fetch higher prices compared to the red and green varieties. The green and red capsicums go for Sh5-Sh10 while the yellow capsicum goes for Sh20-Sh50.
There are two types of capsicums:
i) Sweet pepper/bell pepper (green, red and yellow in colour)ii) Hot pepper
Environmental requirements
Capsicums are warm-season crops and are highly susceptible to frost. The optimum temperature for growth and development is 21oC-24oC for sweet pepper and 21oC-29oC for hot pepper.



if (shouldRenderAd(false)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("desktop-article-ad-1");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



The minimum temperature for both types is 18oC and maximum is 27oC (sweet pepper) and 35oC (hot pepper).
Soils should be well-drained, sandy loam or loam that have high moisture-holding capacity and some organic matter.
The pH should be 6.0-6.5. Pepper is sensitive to salinity. Low night temperatures in July/August are favourable for the production of capsicums.
Fertilisers
Use farmyard manure at 20 tonnes/ha before transplanting, 200kg/ha DSP (10g/plant) at planting, then top dress with 100kg CAN/ha applied in two splits: 1st split when plants are 20-25cm and 2nd 3-5 weeks later.
Excess nitrogen application results in excessive vegetative growth at the expense of fruit production.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



Irrigation
In dry areas, irrigation should be practised to maintain high yields. Capsicums will consume 600-750mm of moisture. Irrigation should be by drip or furrow irrigation. Sprinkler irrigation encourages fungal diseases.
Capsicums are sensitive to water stress which if it occurs during flowering and fruiting, it causes flower drop and fruit abortion. Hence, frequent irrigation is necessary to maintain vegetative and reproductive growth. 
Diseases 
Late blight 
This is fungal and the most destructive disease.
Symptoms: Irregular greenish black water-soaked spots on leaves, which enlarge with time. Appearance of white mycelia growth on lower side of leaves.
Development of small grayish green water-soaked areas which enlarge to cover half of the fruit. Severe defoliation and rots of fruits. 
Control: Use copper-based fungicides, clean seeds and media and ensure good aeration on canopy.
Early blight 
It’s a common fungal disease.  
Symptoms: Canker and collar rot on stems of seedlings and young plants in the field. Development of spots on the leaves that may partly defoliate the plants and greatly reduce yields and fruit quality.
The spots first form on older leaves and enlarge to a diameter of 0.6-1.25cm. Stems develop dark slightly sunken areas that enlarge and become circular or elongated with light centres.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-3']]);
});
}, 62000);
}








Fruit abortion may occur. On older fruits, dark leathery sunken spots develop at the point of attachment to the stem. 
Control: Use copper fungicides, seed treatment and crop rotation.
Bacterial wilt 
It’s characterised by rapid wilting of the plant (more rapid than fusarium wilt). If cut across the stem, a slimy substance oozes out and the pith may be dark or water-soaked in appearance.
Pathogen is soil-borne but may also be introduced through irrigation water and trash. Control: Rotation (4-5 years), rouging and field hygiene.
Pests 
Cutworms
They attack only seedlings by cutting off the stems at or just below the soil surface.
Control: Cultivation to disturb the places they spend during dry periods, use of insecticides and use of cutworm collars.
Green peach aphids
They are usually light green and soft-bodied. They cluster on leaf undersides or on stems. Aphids excrete a sticky liquid called honeydew, which creates spots on foliage.
A black fungus, sooty mould, may then grow on the honeydew. Severe infestations can cause wilting, stunting, curly and leaf distortion. Control is by use of predators to feed on the aphids and use of insecticides.
Leafhoppers
Leafhoppers are small, sap-sacking insects. Attacked capsicums have the tips of leaves turning yellow to brown and becoming brittle. Control can be achieved by removal of infested plants or parts immediately.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-4");
});
}



Leaf miners
The larvae is the most destructive. It makes long-winding mines under the leaf epidermis. The infected leaves are blotchy. Control is by removing infected leaves 
Mites and whiteflies
They suck sap mostly from underside of the leaves and also transmit viruses. Controlled by insecticides or by use of yellow sticky traps.
Market
Locally, capsicums are sold in hotels, hospitals, institutions, directly to consumers in markets or by selling them to middlemen.
Value addition 
Value addition can be done on hot pepper by drying and grinding to get chilli powder, which can be mixed with other dry ingredients like coriander, garlic, ginger and salt.

Benefits of growing capsicums
i) They mature in three months thus farmers can start getting income in a very short time.ii) They have market locally and abroad.iii) It’s a hardy crop.iv) Yellow capsicums fetch a higher market price than the green and red ones.
Nutritional benefits
i) They are rich in vitamins A, B and C.ii) They contain copper, zinc, potassium, manganese and selenium.iii) They can lower cholesterol levels in people who are obese.iv) They contain a substance called capsaicin which is anti-bacterial, anti-carcinogenic, analgesic and has anti-diabetic properties.

Recipe for marmalade
Dear Faith Ndungi, I was inspired by your marmalade recipe and have two questions. How much marmalade does one get from your recipe? I don't have glass jars, can I use recycled screw top containers?Graham Girvan, Kimilili
If the marmalade is to be used in a few weeks, it should be covered with a well-fitting lid and kept in a cool place or in a refrigerator.
Marmalades to be kept for longer periods should be processed in a boiling water bath, sealed with melted wax, cooled, labelled and then stored in a cool dry place.
The jars used should be cleaned and sterilised in boiling water for at least 10 minutes. The containers must be submerged in the boiling water.
After this, they are kept hot either in a slow oven or left in the sterilisation water on top of low heat until the marmalade is ready.
Glass jars are the most preferred. In the case of a recycled container, it should be able to withstand the sterilisation and processing boiling water as well as oven heat.
Most of the recipes outlined in the November 21 article are for small-scale or household-level production.
They produce from one to three kilos of marmalade, which can he held by two to six 500ml jars of marmalade respectively. For large production, the recipe can be increased to suit mass production.

****Milk spoilage
Why does milk get spoilt  the moment I try to boil it?
Cynthia Jeruto
Milk can coagulate on boiling due to salt imbalance attributed to the health of the animal (mastitis disease), stage of lactation (early or late) or type of feed given to the animal. High protein content in milk can also lead to coagulation, such as in colostrum.
Kevine Otieno,Department of Dairy, Food Science & Technology.
****Animal feed ingredients’ crude protein
Please advise: what is the digestible crude protein (DCP) of whole maize, maize germ, wheat bran, wheat pollard, cotton seed cake, sunflower cake, soya bean cake and fishmeal.
William
DCP is the actual amount of crude protein absorbed by an animal. Put differently, it is the protein in the feed minus the protein in the animal waste.
Looking at the feed ingredients you have listed, we have energy sources whole maize, maize germ, wheat bran and wheat pollard and plant protein sources cotton seedcake, sunflower cake, soybean cake as well as animal protein source fishmeal.
When making animal feeds, the nutrient composition of the feed ingredients is determined, followed by determining the nutrient requirement of the animal of interest like cattle, sheep, fish, pets, poultry and pigs to make feeds that meet their nutrient requirements using the same ingredients.

Indigenous rabbit farming
I have been in indigenous rabbit farming for quite some time. I wish to upgrade to hybrids. Is the hybrid venture economical and marketable as compared to the indigenous ones?
Braison Nandalwe Enterprises, Bungoma County.
Exotic breeds of rabbits include Californian white, Flemish giant, New Zealand white, Chinchilla rabbit, the Dutch rabbit, French lop, the Canada giant and their crosses.
Rabbit farming is profitable with dedication and commitment to work, coupled with a good market. Rabbits are kept for their meat, which is healthier, their skins are used in leather-based industries and the urine as a pesticide and foliar.



if (shouldRenderAd(false)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("desktop-article-ad-5");
});
}



Proper housing, recordkeeping, hygiene, nutrition and marketing are among other considerations that are key to the success of rabbit farming.

****Chicken rearing
I want to start indigenous chicken rearing, what advise can you give me? 
Shadrack, Nyamira
Chicken production is critical for improving food and nutritional security at the home level by providing high-quality meat and eggs.
You don’t require a lot of money to start keeping indigenous chickens, since they can be fed on available feeds at home, they are hardy and resistant to some diseases, and have tasty products.



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-8");
});
}



If housed well and their feeds supplemented, they perform better. You can raise cocks for sale especially during the festive season and hens for eggs and multiplication.
There are improved Kienyeji chickens that perform better than local chickens in terms of egg production and growth rate.

Moringa seeds
In the November 21 edition, someone was looking for moringa seedlings and you gave a wrong number for Kefri (0724289781). 
That contact goes to an individual who has no clue about the seedlings. Kindly advise him, I have quality certified mature moringa seedlings.
Wilson
Thank you Wilson for that observation but the farmer specifically wanted moringa seeds and not seedlings.
Moringa seeds are available at Kefri, kindly contact them through 0724 259781/2 or 0722157414 (head office).
