Many workers will be on furlough this Christmas.With the virus still wreaking havoc and not showing any signs of slowing down, we could have a bad Christmas. Despite Kenya’s lockdown measures, the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise and challenges arise with the upcoming holiday season. With the virus still wreaking havoc and not showing any signs of slowing down, we could have a bad Christmas. There will be no church gatherings and most retail chains will not have enough goods in stock. This is mainly because of virus-triggered shutdowns that upended supply chains.

Many workers will be on furlough this Christmas. Some of them would have also been asked to take a pay cut to keep their company afloat. Being able to fork out money to enjoy the season would be a big ask for these people.
There’s also no denying that thousands of people would be without their loved ones because the pandemic has claimed their lives. So rather than having a day of celebration, we would be having a day of reflection. For some reason, the Christmas vibes seem less exciting, year after year.





Staff and family get-togethers
Christmas can be easily placed on the backburner when safety and lifesaving measures are of the utmost importance. Christmas celebrations are one of the most social gatherings — where people enjoy the staff and family get-togethers.
 It is meant to be the most joyous of times, after all, when humanity blends together their religious faiths in the celebration of Jesus Christ on the day of his birth. At this time of the year, such a state of mind is somewhat absent, dismantled, or eviscerated by Covid-19.
As far as religion is concerned, God has forsaken man at these moments. A thunderous silent call to repentance, rather than celebration. Humanity’s collective compassion seems in a state of attrition, too long in a depreciating spiral.

The divine light demands better from us. Retailers are also dealing with their own challenges - the damages sustained by multiple lockdowns. With the rapid downturn suffered by the economy, people suddenly lost all means of income, hence losing the mood to celebrate.
During the Christmas season, Kenyans become party animals; they engage in merry making. While the virus still challenges many, there will always be partying. The rules should ensure the celebrations do not end up in tears.
