With good roads connecting cities and main towns and rural areas investors can put up industries.Young people and other investors should be ready to grab opportunities presented by these road projects. On November 25, when President Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga launched the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 at the KICC, the State House choir corrupted the song ‘Safari ya Bamba ni Machero’ by replacing the word ‘machero’ with ‘rero’.
Perhaps aware delegates may have wondered why the lyrics had changed, the MC Peter Wanjohi quickly announced that it was because the 45-km Mariakani-Bamba road immortalised by the song to bemoan its desolate condition had since been rehabilitated by Kenya Rural Roads Authority.

The road in Ganze, Kilifi County, starting at the Mariakani-Kaloleni road junction and ending up at Bamba Trading Centre, was launched by President Kenyatta in 2016 at a cost of Sh2.1 billion and the roads agency lived to the locals’ expectations to have the first tarmac road since independence.





Such are the tales across the country, including previously marginalised north eastern, where the Kenya National Highway Authority and the Kenya Urban Roads Authority, have either completed or are undertaking roads and rail projects. 
Road network, critical in the Big Four Agenda, boosts economic development since it spurs growth by reducing the cost of transporting agricultural produce, stimulating the revival of industries and creating jobs.
And now, with good roads connecting cities and main towns and rural areas, where land is still available at affordable prices, investors can put up industries, while small and medium enterprises dealing in agribusiness and agro-processing can create job opportunities for the youth.
In cities, by-passes and highways have led to unprecedented growth with enormous business opportunities for the hospitality sector, real estate and the Jua Kali sector.
Modern farming is also thriving in areas previously unimagined. Young people and other investors should be ready to grab opportunities presented by these road projects.
