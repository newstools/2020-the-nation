The three teams have refused to sign an undertaking to be part of a Sh800 million seven-year StarTimes deal. 
The money, as per the terms of the deal, is to be channelled towards production of live league matches to be aired on StarTimes, monthly grants to clubs, and the league’s administrative fees.
“I am not comfortable with FKF taking over commercial and media rights because these belong to clubs. I forwarded these contentious issues to our legal department and we are waiting for feedback,” Ulinzi Stars chairman Col. Erick Oloo said on Tuesday.





He clarified that there have been talks between the club and FKF on the StarTimes broadcast rights deal but no conclusion has been reached.
In the new fixtures,  FKF has rescheduled Gor Mahia vs Ulinzi Stars game to Saturday at Kasarani from 3pm.
“We have not refused to play in the league and will honour the game. Gor Mahia are the home so we have no problem if their match is broadcast,” said Oloo.
The stalemate has led to cancellation of Ulinzi’s league fixture against 29-time  champions Gor Mahia which had been scheduled for today at Nyayo National Stadium.
Ulinzi’s season opener against Mathare United also aborted after both clubs rejected the StarTimes broadcast deal, which has also been opposed by Gor Mahia chairman Ambrose Rachier.

“My players have been training and are ready to play in the league but our home matches should not be broadcast. We are ready to forego the stipend (grants) from this deal,” asserted Oloo.
Zoo Kericho chairman Ken Ochieng has also said the club will not give in to pressure to sign the StarTimes deal “which will give us peanuts and doesn’t have an exit clause.”
“We have been asked to give away our commercial and broadcast rights for seven years in exchange for peanuts, in a deal that has no exit clause. It doesn’t make economic sense,” said Ochieng’.
Rachier is opposed to the deal even after Gor’s embattled secretary-general Sam Ochola controversially signed it.
Two weeks ago, Rachier suspended Ochola, accusing him of signing documents pertaining to the deal without the approval of Gor’s executive committee.
It is understood that Rachier is contemplating going to court to oppose the broadcasting of Gor’s matches on StarTimes.
