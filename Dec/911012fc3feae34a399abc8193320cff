Globally, women enterprises comprise about a third of all enterprises.In Kenya, women account for about 56 per cent of all entrepreneurs in the country. In 2015, African leaders declared it the year of Women’s Empowerment towards Agenda 2063. Subsequently, they dedicated 2016 as the “Year of African Human Rights” with a focus on Women’s Rights.
These declarations saw the development of a scorecard to assess the progress of African countries in reference to seven key sectors. They include access to credit, women in parliament and decision making, employment, business sector, access to land, education and health.

Insufficient attention to capacity building for African women entrepreneurs and inadequate access to resources has meant that their contribution to the economic growth and the general wellbeing of communities and families has been curtailed. 
Economic structures such as financial markets and institutions, labour markets, economic and social infrastructure, social security systems and legislations hardly take into consideration the interests of women.

Basic necessities
Globally, women enterprises comprise about a third of all enterprises and contribute significantly to employment generation and development. Women are Africa’s engine: they maintain 90 per cent of the informal economy; they produce 80 per cent of the food; they support more than 40 per cent of the basic necessities of the continent's families and significantly contribute to peace (FAO).
The facilitation of women entrepreneurs to participate more in wealth creation goes beyond increasing household incomes to reduce poverty and seeks the growth of entrepreneurship for job creation and economic development.
In Kenya, as in many other African countries, the expansion of the informal sector and of self-organised and independent enterprises is, in large part, created by women whose collaborative, self-help and traditional practices and initiatives in production and trade are a vital economic resource.

When they gain access to and control over capital, credit, technology, training and other resources, women significantly increase production, marketing and income for sustainable development.
In Kenya, women account for about 56 per cent of all entrepreneurs in the country according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistic, 2006.
However, research indicates that there is very little connection between researchers and institutions that implement and advocate for women's economic empowerment.
The importance of evidence for policymakers will help them focus on what works to drive decision making for women’s economic empowerment.
The University of Nairobi, in collaboration with Bill and Melinda Gates, therefore, wants to focus on providing cutting edge research to policymakers and implementors to influence decisions, and upscale already existing programs.
For instance, access to government procurement opportunities which is globally rated as one of the best policies. 
However, its uptake has been slow, together with that of Women Enterprise Fund, among other affirmative action funds. The Hub, which is part of a network of Women Economic Empowerment (WEE) Hubs, plans to focus on what works to drive change.

Tremendous responsibilities
Women’s experience with the Constitution review process indicates that laws, legislations, regulations and policies can drive change. This leads us-the multi-disciplinary team of researchers at the University of Nairobi to focus on three main areas.
They are; Affirmative Action Funds and Women’s Entrepreneurship, Women in Formal and informal employment, and Child Care and Women's Work. 
The last of these areas of focus is chosen because of the tremendous responsibilities that women have in taking care of children as well as having time for their businesses or employment.
The change in gender norms becomes important for this research. Policy advocacy, interaction with the policymakers, working together with civil societies and women's organisations becomes important if we are to unlock the potential for women economic empowerment.
Women’s economic empowerment as a process increases women’s right to economic resources and their power to make decisions to benefit themselves, their families and their communities.
This requires equal access to, and control over economic resources, assets, opportunities and long-term changes in social norms and economic structures that benefit women and men equally.

} When ratified and fully implemented, the agreement is expected to deliver significant benefits. The daily flights will leave JKIA at 3:30 pm to arrive in Ukunda at 4:30pm targeting leisure travellers on the coastal circuit. Residents of Mombasa have been eagerly waiting the commissioning of the bridge. Ms Nthenya was freed without any charges being preferred against her. Just last week, Justice James Rika recused himself from the case after tempers flared in court.
