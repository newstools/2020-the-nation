Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo has declared war on corruption and staff lethargy to restore sanity in the county as he assumed leadership following the death of Governor John Nyagarama.
In his inauguration speech, Mr Nyaribo promised to ruthlessly tackle corruption in the county even as many speakers implored him not to appear like he was taking revenge against his critics for the eight years he has served as Deputy Governor.

Mr Nyaribo said that the county has a bloated wage bill at 60 percent of county revenue, which is way above the required limit of 35 per cent.
“This wage bill is not only irregular, but also unsustainable. To address this issue, my government will take appropriate measures aimed at reducing the wage bill to the required limit as provided for in legislation,” said the new governor.





Nyagarama's allies
County employees allied to Mr Nyagarama, including Executives, fear that they will be the first victims of Mr Nyaribo’s purge of the county administration.
Most of them were conspicuously missing from the inauguration ceremony of Mr Nyaribo, who warned employees who have underperformed in the past.
 “Those county staff who are earning huge salaries and are not performing will not have a place in this government. If they go, we will not pursue them,” he said.
Mr Nyaribo and Mr Nyagarama had an on and off relationship since their election in 2013. On many occasions, Mr Nyaribo differed with his boss over a number of issues ranging from corruption, appointment of staff and general management of the county government.
As he ascends to the high office, residents will be keen to see how he cleans the alleged mess. His cristism drew a wedge between him, the late governor and their supporters.

Residents are waiting to see the person he appoints as his deputy with a key focus on how he balances the two major clans in Nyamira county. Clan determines the voting pattern in the devolved unit.
The ceremony
Mr Nyaribo was sworn-in at noon as the county chief following the death of Mr Nyagarama on December 18 at the Nairobi Hospital where he had been admitted for more than a month.
Mr Nyaribo, who becomes the county’s second governor, took the oath of office at a ceremony led by presiding judge Esther Maina.
County Secretary James Ntabo handed him the instruments of power, including Nyamira's flag and seal.
The ceremony took place at Nyamira Primary School grounds, the venue where Mr Nyagarama's funeral service took place.
Among the guests were Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, Council of Governors chair and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, Kisii Governor James Ongwae and Nyamira Senator Okong'o Omogeni.
Also present were MPs Jerusha Momanyi (Nyamira Woman Rep), Vincent Kemosi (West Mugirango), Ben Momanyi (Borabu), Shadrack Mose (Kitutu Masaba) and Joash Nyamoko (North Mugirango).





No revenge
Leader after leader urged Mr Nyaribo not to revenge, but to focus on delivering services to Nyamira residents.

Mr Wamalwa said the national government will support the new governor as he assumes office to ensure smooth delivery of services.
Mr Oparanya said being a governor is not an easy task and advised the new governor to be ready to be criticised and abused.
“Be ready to listen to all. You will now have many friends who will tell you all manner of things. Listen to them but make the right decisions,” said Mr Ongwae who was a close ally of the former governor.
