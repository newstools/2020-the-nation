Mr Ali further claimed the youths were armed with knives and batons.
"The person in command was Governor Hassan Ali Joho. We fled the scene but they followed us in their cars, " he claimed.
Mr Ali also said Mr Joho's brother Said Abdallah Saido confronted him at the polling station.
A video seen by the Nation shows the two -- Mr Abdullah and Mr Ali -- in an altercation before police intervene.
The MP noted that he could not record the statement at Msambweni Police Station as the rival group was chasing after him.
