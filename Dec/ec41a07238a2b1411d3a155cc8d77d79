The media’s negative impact on society is less understood.The hyper-partisanship of modern times rages on because most people rarely confront the unfiltered views of those with whom they disagree US President Donald Trump’s claim that the media is the enemy of the people is absurd. But that doesn’t mean it is the people’s best friend.
The media is, instead, more like the frenemy of the people: its impact on society is a mix of good and bad. The media’s positive impact on society is well understood (in part because journalists consistently remind us about it).

The media is, to be sure, a fundamental bulwark against concentrated power — in both the government and the private sector — that consistently brings to light important facts. The media also, at its best, produces high quality analysis about significant subjects.
The media’s negative impact on society is less understood (in part because the media does not talk about it often). It’s deficiencies, however, are fundamental. First, the media is partisan. A majority of journalists are liberal; there’s a robust conservative minority; and in between is an apolitical middle.





Modern media
This mix of ideologies interacts in a modern media ecosystem that has devolved into a fragmented echo chamber of bias and prejudgment.  The near-unlimited menu of news content — on television, radio, the Internet, and print — allows people to gravitate towards what they want. It also insulates them from what they don’t want. The hyper-partisanship of modern times rages on because most people rarely confront the unfiltered views of those with whom they disagree.
Second, the media’s incentive structure is misaligned. Journalists’ goals are often at odds with accurate reporting. They are motivated to become famous; to create buzzworthy headlines; to sell the news. Boring stories that explain slow-moving or unexciting subject matter — no matter how important — do not generate excitement. And positive or congratulatory articles about people in power — no matter how impressive their accomplishments — are snoozers likely to be ignored.

Oversimplified narratives
Controversy sells. Substance does not. The bigger the controversy, the more eyeballs; the more eyeballs, the more clicks; the more clicks, the more advertising revenue. And so on.
This flywheel has accelerated exponentially in the modern age of unlimited content, deep fragmentation, and decreasing media-company profit margins.
The 24-hour news cycle is fuelled not by thorough and objective analysis, but instead by the snap-shot partisanship that people crave. Finally, the media produces oversimplified narratives.  It is essential that the public is appraised of important facts regarding society.
All too often, however, journalists weave these facts into incomplete storylines. Waiting for all the facts to emerge when your competition already tweeted its headline is simply not an option.
