The Chief Administrative Secretary in the Ministry of Education, Zakaria Kinuthia, revealed in a televised interview on December 14 that it will not be possible for students to observe social distancing when schools reopen in January.
He further clarified that if social distancing were to be observed fully as recommended by the Ministry of Health, the schools will only be able to accommodate one third of the total number of students.

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



It is refreshing that a senior government official has for once come out candidly to make an admission that will go a long way to help all stakeholders make informed decisions on the way forward as January approaches instead of skirting around such an important issue.
In any case, even if the government were to provide resources for tripling infrastructure in all schools, we would lack the artisans to enable construction of these facilities at once and within time constraints.

});
}, 62000);
}



Before delving into the challenges that this decision will lead to in schools, I wish to raise two pertinent issues that are likely to arise from it. First, would the Ministry of Health overlook the requirement of social distancing for the sake of reopening, considering that schools have high population densities per square-kilometre, compared to other spaces in Kenya?
If not, which of the two positions will be adopted by the government? Secondly, international practice has indicated that when social distancing is ignored, Covid-19 infections go up.
Thanksgiving weekend
The infections in the US have increased tremendously to well over 200,000 per day just after the “thanksgiving” weekend when families are reported to have interacted closely. All countries in Europe, except Sweden and Finland, have instituted the most rigorous measures against social interaction in order to guard against a spike in infections over the Christmas and end-of-the-year festivities.



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-2");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



In Kenya, there has not been a total lockdown in any county and none is expected before January. The teachers and students are, therefore, likely to transmit infections to schools on January 4, arising from their end-of-year social interactions. This will happen in a state in which schools are congested and social distancing overlooked.
 Not all is lost, however. Reports from various countries, including the USA, Russia, the United Kingdom and India, are that they have developed vaccines. In view of this development, it is my view that the government should move with speed to purchase these vaccines and prioritise vaccination of teachers and students as well as medical personnel to counter the effects of congestion and overlooking social distancing. However, the logistics of procuring and carrying out vaccination will take time.
As a compromise between the importance of the safety of the students and the need for them to be in school, could the government consider reopening of Standard Six, Standard Seven in primary, and Form Three in secondary in January, alongside Grade Four, Standard Eight and Form Four as vaccinations get underway? The student population at both levels will be 50 per cent.



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-3");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-3']]);
});
}, 62000);
}








That will be close to one third that would be ideal for social distancing. The remaining classes would then be recalled to schools by say, March, when vaccines will have been administered and normalcy attainable.
Internal measures
In the meantime, the boards of management of schools need to work on internal measures to control infections. They may need to dedicate several teachers to manage the Covid-19 protocols. This will include ensuring that a sufficient number of thermal guns are available and that all students are subjected to temperature checks every morning.
The same teachers would need to ensure that clean running water and soap as well as face masks are available at all times. The government on its part needs to ensure that capitation is released to schools on a timely basis to enable schools to buy whatever they must to combat the pandemic
The greatest challenge that should be a lesson to the country arising from this pandemic is lack of clean running water in schools. Conservative estimates are that up to 50 per cent of schools are water-deficient. The national and county governments need to synergise and prioritise provision of water henceforth. Meanwhile, 2021 will certainly be a difficult year for schools.
