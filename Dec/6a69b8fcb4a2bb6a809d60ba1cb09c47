A Nigerian national who allegedly conned a female friend of Sh31million has gotten a reprieve after the Kibera Law Courts allowed him more time to settle the matter out of the court with the complainant.
Edwin Chukwudiebere Okoye is accused of conspiring with others to defraud Bella Bronislavia of the said amount of money on diverse dates between May 1, 2017 and May 14, 2018.

The accused and his accomplices purported to be in need of the money to fund a business. Okoye is also facing charges of obtaining money by false pretenses.
He is accused of receiving Sh31million by falsely pretending that he had won a government tender that needed funding, knowing the claims he made to Bronislavia were false.
The two met at B Club in Nairobi's Kilimani area and became friends, with Okoye claiming that he some contracts.

Negotiating 
The court heard how on other times he would claim there were phones he wanted to introduce into the Kenya market but did not have enough money.
The accused allegedly asked the complainant to lend him money promising to top up with a commission.
The complainant complied by transferring various amounts of money from her bank account to that od the accused, for a total sum of Sh31million.
The court was informed that since then, Okoye has never made any repayment. Subsequently, the complainant reported the matter to the police and Okoye was later arrested.
When he appeared before Senior Principal Magistrate Derrick Kutto at the Kibera Law Courts, Okoye claimed through a lawyer that he was negotiating with the complainant with a view of paying the money over the weekend.
