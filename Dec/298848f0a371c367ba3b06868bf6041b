Why did Deputy President William Ruto fail to attend the funeral of Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama last week? Well, our source says security officials had been briefed the deputy president was coming and his allies had been facilitated to mobilise people and “soften the ground”. 
Local leaders in his camp were also waiting for him at the funeral, before many of them melted away after realising he would not be joining the mourners.

For a man who has made numerous visits to Nyamira and Kisii counties, and who is known to attend several events in a day, our source attributes his keeping off to fears of a hostile reception and fears of facing off with ODM leader Raila Odinga and local leaders allied to the President.

Officials celebrate Sonko ouster
A number of senior City Hall officials, including county executives and chief officers, attended a night party to celebrate the impeachment of their former boss Mike Sonko, a Talk of the Town mole has learnt. 





The night party, which was held at the restaurant of a high-end members’ club in Nairobi, was organised by the pro-impeachment MCAs and kicked off immediately the Senate voted to uphold the ouster of Sonko. 
Interestingly, the senior county officers included those who have been close to the flamboyant city politician. Among the celebrants were also most of the ward representatives who had been ferried to Kwale County by the former Makadara MP.

Besides, many of the staff members had a dull Christmas as salaries had also not been paid by the time they were breaking. Despite the majority of the LSK Council having passed a resolution to have the staff paid Christmas bonuses, the society’s beleaguered president, who was not present, ‘vetoed’ the decision.

Water vendors frustrate residents
Just for how long will a cartel involving water company staff and water bowser owners in Buruburu continue to frustrate residents in the supply of water in their taps? In recent months, residents of Buruburu estate have not had their share of rationed water. 
Water company staff who connect the supply every Tuesday morning have not been doing so ostensibly to allow the cartel of water vendors at City Hall to sell water to the desperate residents. The water vendors have had a field day for the last four months despite several complaints by residents.

Official in trouble over procurement 
Back to City Hall. A top official of a State Corporation previously under the Ministry of Transport but now moved to National Treasury after a loose merger, is in trouble. 
He has, on two occasions, ignored orders from the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority over procurement issues. The Authority has now referred the matter to the big man’s board and also to Directorate of Criminal Investigations for disciplinary action and criminal prosecution, respectively. Disobeying PPRA’s orders can result to a Sh4 million fine or 20 years in prison, or both.

Firms threaten to expose governor
A governor in one of the Mount Kenya counties is in trouble. The man has been bragging how his leasing programme has endeared him to the voters. Having been approached by several companies, the governor promised them work on condition they parted with bribes. 
Now having taken bribes from several companies, the work available could only be done by a handful of companies. The companies that missed out are demanding their cash back or else they expose the county executive. 
It seems that 2021 will be a rocky ride for the governor who will be seeking re-election. Here's a list of the people who hit headlines in the biggest way this year. An interdenominational prayer service was held at Nyamira Primary School ahead of tomorrow’s burial. Faiza Wanjiru reveals the tactics used by criminals to target cash-rich revellers. Bishop Kariuki appeals for government assistance to private schools, saying most are currently struggling. Mechanical problem is believed to have been caused by the heavy load and the area’s topography.
