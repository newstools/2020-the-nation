Five support staff at Lugulu Girls High School have been sent on compulsory leave for allegedly inciting students to stage a protest.
The five are the school nurse, cateress, store keeper and two cooks.
A suspension letter seen by the Nation says the leave will end on January 10, 2021.
Students of the school in Bungoma County last week took to the streets in a protest against the alleged defilement of their schoolmate.

It is said the attacker also tried to suffocate the victim but that she managed to scream, waking other girls. The attacker disappeared into the darkness.
"We are wondering why we have been sent home yet the students were demanding justice for one of them who was defiled,” one of the suspended staff members who sought anonymity for fear of being victimised said.
The worker said the letter stated that one of them was suspended for inciting other subordinate staff to protest over delayed salaries.

“We received half salaries in October and November,” the staffer said.
Iron fist
Residents of Bungoma County have accused the school’s Principal Dina Cheruiyot of running the institution with an iron fist.
They have poked holes into the award of tenders and alleged tribalism in employment.
Ms Cheruiyot did not respond to the Nation’s phone calls and messages on Sunday when sought for comment on the suspensions and the allegations against her.
The school's board of management (BoM) closed it indefinitely as police officers continue to investigate the defilement incident.
Bungoma East police boss Valerian Obore said officers are following leads in the search for the suspect.
The school's BoM decided to close it indefinitely as police and the administration investigate the incident.

Bungoma East Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) Secretary-General Aggrey Namisi said that the students were angered by principal’s slow response after the matter was reported and failure to take action.

Bojamaa@ke.nationmedia.com Learners accused principal of not taking action and harassing them whenever they complained. Protesting learners said the student was attacked on Saturday morning while taking a bath just before the morning preps. Mr Noordin Haji terms last week’s decision unfair and without any factual or legal bases. Ms Agnes Wangui said in court papers that the Matungu MP sired two children with her. The televangelist was charged with killing the woman by dangerous driving.
