Tourism players have pleaded with President Uhuru Kenyatta to ignore calls for a new lockdown, saying the industry has not recovered from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Nairobi, Mombasa, Kiambu, Nakuru, Kajiado, Uasin Gishu, Busia, Machakos, Kisumu and Kilifi counties lead in infections.
Kenya Tourism Federation, Kenya Coast Tourism Association, Kenya Coast Working Group and Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers urged the President to reject the proposal.
Special passes
“Governors should focus on providing isolation centres and equipping health workers and hospitals,” Kenya Tourism Federation chairman Mohamed Hersi said.





“It is no secret that governors did a good PR job on their preparedness in dealing with the pandemic. Anyone pushing for another lockdown is not serious. We must balance health and livelihoods. The virus is with us.”
Mr Hersi said Kenyans want governors to ensure the Ministry of Health guidelines are followed.
“These same governors pushing for a lockdown will get special passes to move from one county to another. This must be resisted,” he added.
“Let them spend their time and energy on handling health workers strikes and stop the sideshows. Let governors ensure doctors are paid. Doctors are not our first line of defence. They are our last and only line.”

“Things can change if the government eases restrictions and allows people to travel. Tougher restrictions will inconvenience many. The whole country will be affected. Let people be allowed to celebrate as long as they observe the health protocols,” Dr Ikwaye told the Nation.
“Festivities should not be ruined. Irresponsible selling of alcohol is what the government should restrict.”
Hotel bookings are at a record low. Tourism stakeholders attribute the situation to fears of an impending lockdown and travel restrictions.
