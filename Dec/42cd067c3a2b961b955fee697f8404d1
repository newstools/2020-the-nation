A Malindi businessman is celebrating Christmas in pain after police officers enforcing the ongoing curfew allegedly manhandled him, breaking his arm.
Mr Zackayo Kaibunga was accused of being out after 10pm, when the curfew starts. He had to seek treatment from a private hospital in Malindi following the beating.

Malindi Sub-County Police Commander Joe Lekuta, who at first was reluctant to respond to the report, said they have launched investigations into allegations that the businessman was brutally beaten by police.
“He was found operating against the curfew hours and resisted arrest,” he told journalists.
However, Mr Kaibunga told journalists at Meridian Hospital, where he was admitted, that police accosted him while he was driving home at around 10.30pm.
“They later dragged me out of my car and began beating me up. They then bungled me into their van and robbed me of Sh105,000 cash which I had withdrawn to pay workers,” the trader said.





He said trouble started when he tried to plead with the officers to allow him to drive himself to the police station.
Roughed up
''I then made a phone call and immediately after making that call they roughed me up, holding my waist and dragged me towards the police land cruiser. I took my phone and put it inside the pocket,” he said.
He said the officers dragged him to the door of their van and as they lifted him his hand twisted and despite shouting in pain the officers pushed him into their vehicle.
''A female police officer who was in the team informed the deputy OCS that I had been injured. They drove with me leaving my vehicle open with its engine running and lights on,” he said.

Mr Kaibunga said there were three other people in the van who had been arrested by the officers. He added that he refused to alight from the police vehicle, insisting that they take him to Malindi Sub-County Hospital.
X-ray examination
“After carrying out X-ray examinations which indicated that I had a fractured arm and the initial treatment, I was returned to the police station since I was under arrest,” he said.
He was later released on free bond and underwent surgery at Meridian Hospital where he incurred a Sh150,000 bill.
''I have been trying to follow up on my money which I was robbed by the police but they claim they are not aware of it,” he said.
Mr Phillip Matara, a Malindi activist, condemned the police brutality and wondered why the officers could not just arrest him and take him to the station then charge him in a court of law.
He said a similar incident occurred in Kisii where a youth lost his life to police brutality for allegedly flouting the curfew rule.
Mr Matara said Malindi is a tourist destination and its reputation should not be spoiled by a few rogue police officers who do not respect human rights.
