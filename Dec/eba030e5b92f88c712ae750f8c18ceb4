Our education sector would be brought to an abrupt shutdown, thanks to its reliance on the brick-and-mortar in-person mode of delivery. First came the hospitality industry, as flights got grounded.Children got to see the faces of their parents, mostly fathers, after a long while. Like any other new year, 2020 began with lots of optimism and great promise. I remember folks joking about it, pronouncing it as ‘dwendy dwendy’ idiosyncratic of some native dialectic.
It was billed as a year of double blessings as indicated by the ‘double twenty’. Then Covid-19 happened. The events that would later unfold were like a huge mirror placed before us, reflecting our real situation; our real strengths and vulnerabilities.

The events tested the mettle of our nation and its structures. We came to know our health systems better. Our education sector would be brought to an abrupt shutdown, thanks to its reliance on the brick-and-mortar in-person mode of delivery.
Firms closed down, since most were client-facing ventures. First came the hospitality industry, as flights got grounded. The entertainment industry followed. Eventually, all non-essential service providers would either be furloughed or sent home for good. It was the worst scene in a horror movie.





But against all these came myriads of lessons. As a country, we learned that a time could come when each nation would be by itself, with none looking to the other for rescue. We would reckon how critical it was for each to establish strong systems, more so economically, such that we would survive, albeit for a while, without flying out or expecting manna from foreigners. We equally learned that the devil never sleeps, as evidenced by those who stole resources allocated towards management of Covid-19. Indeed, corruption knows no seasons.
Urban-rural migration
We learned how strategic devolution was. It was not lost on us how the rural folks came to the aid of the urbanites, seeing the voluminous foodstuffs that were ferried to towns and cities in a bid to rescue those who had either lost livelihoods or were caught up in lockdowns. We also witnessed urban-rural migration, for the centre that is our urban cities could not hold. Without a doubt, devolved units must be made fully functional.

});
}, 62000);
}



At individual levels, we equally learned lessons. Parents learned the importance of teachers, seeing how children had outwitted them in their own homes. Various individuals would be forced to spend long hours with close family members, with some getting into friction with one another.
Children got to see the faces of their parents, mostly fathers, after a long while. Chicken had finally come home to roost.
Against all this, we reckoned the magnitude of work ahead of us. There are debts to be paid, relationships to be repaired, firms to be revived, and so many other broken pieces that need to be reassembled.
Whereas many lives and livelihoods were regrettably lost, the fact that we are still alive provides reassurance that we are conquerors — whether by divine power or sheer resilience. We therefore have another chance to breathe new life into our struggles, and make our existence more meaningful not only to ourselves but to humanity in general. Lessons learnt should guide us into the New Year and subsequent futures.
