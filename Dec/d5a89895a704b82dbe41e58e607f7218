In Dennis Itumbi’s retracing of Bogonko’s activities before he went missing, he reveals that on his last weekend, the journalist used public means to visit a woman in Mwea, a town in the central Kenya region. Bogonko is said to have first met this woman on a political Facebook page.  Who is this mysterious woman? What is her side of the story? And did Bogonko return to Nairobi after this visit?  In this episode, we scrutinise Bogonko’s final year while tackling a subject that affects many journalists in Kenya - alcoholism. We speak to Bogonko's friends and family, who insist that Mr Itumbi must know something about the blogger's whereabouts. Sonko will need 24 elected senators to survive his removal from office.
