The ODM chief said the illiterate electorate are already overburdened by six ballot papers.In a message likely to shut the door on the DP over his continued call for a multiple-choice referendum, Mr Odinga said the process is now headed for a 'Yes' or 'No' vote. ODM leader Raila Odinga has likened the proposal by Deputy President William Ruto for a multiple-choice referendum to subjecting Kenyans to a confusing school examination.
Mr Odinga also fired a warning shot at organisations which he claimed have been going round trying to sway county assemblies to reject the Constitutional Amendment Bill 2020 when it is tabled before the various Houses.

Speaking separately in Kisumu and Vihiga yesterday, the ODM chief said the illiterate electorate are already overburdened by six ballot papers.
He said it would be unfair to add not just a seventh one but 10 or more questions on parts of the referendum that they agree with or oppose. “It is like sending someone to an examination. Even for someone who has been in school for 12 years, it will be a challenge and now you are asking an illiterate person to do that on the same day there is a general election,” said Mr Odinga.

Shut the door
In a message likely to shut the door on the DP over his continued call for a multiple-choice referendum, Mr Odinga said the process is now headed for a 'Yes' or 'No' vote.
“That is an individual who wants to say no, but doesn’t have the strength of character to say I oppose. He is pretending and basically trying to hold the country back,” said Mr Odinga after he met Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o and his Kakamega counterpart Wycliffe Oparanya.
Speaking in Musalia Mudavadi's Vihiga home turf, Mr Odinga stressed the point further, saying Dr Ruto is opposed to the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) and is only bringing up the issue of a multiple-choice referendum to derailing the process.

Mr Odinga was attending the burial of Timothy Amiani, 78, at Kegondi in Sabatia. The deceased was the father of Busia Woman Representative Florence Mutua, who is also the ODM assistant secretary-general.

Mr Odinga sensationally claimed the said organisations are ‘poisoning’ the minds of ward reps so that they shoot down the BBI Bill when it is brought to them early next year. “I want to tell the organisations that they are engaging in a futile process,” said Mr Odinga.
Revenue generation
Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya urged the proponents of the multiple-choice vote to lead the "No camp".
The Council of Governors chairman called on healthcare workers who are on strike to return to work. "Due to Covid-19, revenue generation has gone down and this is a new normal," he said.
Mr Oparanya said he will be at the Senate today to push for a solution to the health crisis.
Also present at the burial were Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and MPs Caleb Amisi (Saboti), Godfrey Osotsi (Nominated), Beatrice Adagala (Vihiga County) and Benard Shinali (Ikolomani). President works harder to appease his deputy and Odinga as the DP plays it safe earning the ‘watermelon’ tag. If the current political dalliance between President Kenyatta and ODM chief Odinga lasts upto 2022, then their side is most likely to pick Prime Minister.
