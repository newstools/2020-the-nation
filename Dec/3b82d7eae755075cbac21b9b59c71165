The protest by lecturers at Egerton University against the return of the vice-chancellor through a court order is shocking.The universities are managed by councils and superintended by the Ministry of Education.  As the year comes to a close, it is appropriate to review the challenges and successes that the education sector registered in order to focus on the future.
I wish to start with the disturbing scenario of governance in public universities that for students and parents is anything but inspiring.
In the past, there were isolated cases of members of primary school committees that occasionally used padlocks to lock out headteachers to force their transfer on allegations of poor performance in KCPE exams.

With time, the Teachers Service Commission has empowered boards of management to initiate discipline procedures against suspected head teachers within the confines of properly constituted meetings thus saving parents the previous archaic practice locking offices.
The protest by lecturers at Egerton University against the return of the vice-chancellor through a court order is shocking. This happening within the same year that the University of Nairobi had a protracted process of recruiting the current Vice Chancellor is serious cause for concern in the sector. Moi University had had a similar situation few years earlier.

Take extra classes
The universities are managed by councils and superintended by the Ministry of Education.  In addition, the recruitment of vice-chancellors is carried out competitively, and in the last few years, by the Public Service Commission (PSC). The members of the councils are competent and seasoned academicians/administrators and so are senior officials of the ministry and the PSC.
For lecturers to demonstrate in 2020, just like primary school parents of the years gone by,  to express dissatisfaction against their vice-chancellors, when one considers the competencies abounding at the universities,  calls for a review of the management structures and procedures. It does not seem likely that lecturers are wrong all the time.

At the primary and secondary school levels, the 100 per cent transition of students and the introduction of the competency-based curriculum (CBC) dominated discussion in the year.
That a significant number of secondary schools would be forced to take extra classes to actualise the transition rate without prior notice when statistics of candidates at class eight is known well in advance speaks volumes about planning and governance in the sector.
Junior secondary
Furthermore, the infrastructural requirements in secondary schools in the years 2023 and 2024 and the criteria of admitting students into junior secondary without an examination or any other acceptable objective method are issues of concern.
 The Technical and Vocational Education Training sub sector was possibly the most successful in the sector. More institutes were opened, more than 2,000 lecturers were recruited and a number of lecturers promoted to principals of the new institutes has raised the morale. The recruitment process of lecturers was, however, slow and the procedure tedious and repetitive.
The Covid-19 pandemic worldwide has come with major challenges in the education sector with no precedence to fall back to for solutions. The effect it is having on the calendars at all levels of education is a major challenge that will affect the system for years to come.

Special curriculum
As we enter 2021, there is an urgent need for all institutions to review their strategic plans since closure has affected implementation timelines. In addition, there are major issues to be considered.
First, all institutions must strategise on how to provide education with all the protocols required to combat the pandemic. Secondly, secondary schools have to plan on how to accommodate double intake in 2023 and 2024 and retain the CBC students for six years.
The TSC would have to plan to provide the teachers required for a diversified and specialised curriculum. The ministry and the Treasury must plan for a longer period of provision of capitation for secondary schools, which cost more per student than at the primary level.  The universities would have to revise their curricula and teaching methods to be in tandem with the CBC requirements.
At the ministry and in the university councils, the expectation of parents that the recruitment of vice-chancellors will be streamlined to a level that the transitions between them be seamless.
Lecturers should be focusing on research and teaching instead of demonstrating against their bosses.
