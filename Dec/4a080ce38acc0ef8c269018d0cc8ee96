Keep a plate of natural products so that young people can help themselves, as they may eat some prominent nutrients. According to a report in the Children’s Health Club magazine, junk food can affect children’s physical development in harmful ways, including unhealthy weight-gain, which can lead to self-esteem problems.
Low esteem can lead to depression and other consequences. According to the American Family Physician, depression — which can be very dangerous for children — has a negative impact on growth and development, performance in school and social relations, and ultimately leads to suicide.
