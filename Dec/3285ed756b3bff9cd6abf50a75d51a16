A sombre mood engulfed Nyamira County as reality of the passing of governor John Nyagarama sank on the residents on Wednesday.
An interdenominational prayer service was held at Nyamira Primary School grounds in the governor’s honour, setting the tone for the burial ceremony tomorrow.

At about 2.30am, elected leaders from Gusii jetted in from Nairobi. Under normal circumstances, Mr Nyagarama would lead such delegations, but his absence sent more grief to his supporters who say they felt like orphaned children.
Before flying in from Nairobi, the leaders welcomed President Uhuru Kenyatta at Nyagarama’s Karen home where he had gone to condole with the family of the late governor.
