A recent court case in which a pay television service sued local internet providers for failure to take down links that illegally streamed the company’s licensed sports content highlights the challenge piracy poses to content producers.
The distribution of unlicensed content may hinder the development of the television industry in Africa. In the last decade, the rise in digital television stations in Kenya has offered viewers a variety of local and international content.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-1");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



An increasing demand in content and competition for audiences has forced digital content providers to seek innovative ways to fill their broadcast schedules.
One of the requirements for a commercial free-to-air television licence as laid down by the Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK) is to submit a plan that includes the particulars of the proposed station’s programming schedule.



if (shouldRenderAd(false)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("desktop-article-ad-1");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



This includes strategies pertaining to self-produced programmes and their weekly proportions and any planned external source of programming.
Another key requirement is a quality assurance plan. Both of these are meant to ensure that licence holders have developed solid strategic content development plans.
Unauthorised content
However, the challenge of producing local quality programmes has led some providers to take advantage of weak enforcement to distribute unauthorised content either by the direct download of YouTube material and then re-broadcasting on their channels, or playing unlicensed movies.
Unlicensed and pirated content often exhibit poor quality video and audio [and] may present in a foreign language without subtitles.
Fast internet access, lack of adequate legislation, increased participation of organised cross-border pirates and more recently, an upsurge in audience due to Covid-19 containment measures means that video piracy is on the rise.



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-2");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



According to global tech advisory firm AB Research, more than 17 per cent of worldwide video streaming users are consuming content illegally.
Tackling the piracy menace should include improved monitoring and self-regulation. Section 8 of CAK’s Programming Code for Broadcasting Services 2019 states that broadcasters must have contracts with copyright licensing bodies or authorised legal vendors before running copyrighted material and “shall, upon request, submit such contracts to the authority”. Innovation in the local broadcast industry is inevitable.
