Kirinyaga County has started the process of developing an urban economic plan for the Kerugoya-Kutus Municipality.
The launch of the plan, which was held in Kerugoya on Wednesday, brought together stakeholders from both the private and the public sectors.
The process is expected to give the county its first-ever urban economic plan within the next eight months.

The plan, which is being developed through a partnership between the Kirinyaga county government and UKAID-funded Sustainable Urban Economic Development (SUED) Programme, will carry the vision and objectives of Kerugoya-Kutus Municipality and define its economic sector action plans, value chain development and priority infrastructure projects.
Governor Anne Waiguru has said this is a historic event since the fast-growing Kerugoya-Kutus Municipality will now have a plan that will promote economic growth in a sustainable and inclusive manner, through prioritised integrated projects.

Husks factory
Ms Waiguru pointed out that among the value chain projects to be undertaken through SUED will be a husks factory that will be a source of employment and which will also help in adding value to by-products of various agricultural products such as rice.
She added that the plan will also enable the county administration to prioritise and implement the projects that have maximum benefits for the residents and those that will ensure the desired economic future of Kirinyaga.
“We are very happy to be among the only 12 municipalities out of 59 that were selected for SUED funding that will enable impactful projects in the county,” said Governor Waiguru.

Kerugoya-Kutus Municipality has a population of about 51,000 people drawn from Nyangati, Kabare, Kanyekiine, Inooi and Kerugoya wards.
So far, the SUED partnership has facilitated capacity building for municipal staff and board to enable them implement investment promotion strategies as well as enhance their capacity in managing the municipality and undertake infrastructural development.
The governor assured Kirinyaga residents that the process of developing the UEP will be all-inclusive and will capture the aspirations of locals.
Kerugoya Ward MCA James Kamau Murango, who is also the county assembly Majority Leader, said that the SUED programme will have a huge impact on the people of Kirinyaga, noting that Kerugoya-Kutus Municipality has a great potential that can be harnessed to make it a major investment hub.
SUED Deputy Team Leader Monicah Motshegwe said the UEP will include projects that will be identified during stakeholder engagement forums which will be all-inclusive in order to accommodate the social-economic dynamics of the county. Municipality is among seven out of 59 countrywide which met World Bank’s minimum KUSP grant conditions. Waiguru says accelerated programme will see health workers traverse villages.
