"The raiders are roaming the village with impunity, stealing animals from villagers and our pleas to security agencies have fallen on deaf ears," she complained.
Another villager, Pauline Murugi, narrated how she lost four cows to the raiders, saying the attackers also seriously injured her son.
Ms Murugi said she has been forced to abandon cattle rearing after being attacked several times.
"I have lost animals to the attackers on several occasions and the law enforcers are not doing much to deal with the situation," she said.

Police blamed
The villagers drawn from Karima, Kigecha, Nyakinyua, Satellite and Utheri wa Lari villages called on the government to address their plight, admitting that they are living in mortal fear.
Naivasha MP Jayne Kihara, who toured the area on Friday, blamed security agencies for runaway crime.
"It is the responsibility of the government to protect her people and their properties. I urged the security agencies present, led by the Deputy County Commissioner, to  work closely with members of the public to ensure that this criminal act comes to an end," Ms Kihara said.

She promised to take up the matter with the Interior Ministry, saying police had failed in their duties.
"As the people's representative, I will knock on the door of every relevant government office to ensure my people are protected," she said.
