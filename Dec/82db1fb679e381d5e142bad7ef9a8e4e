Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju said the names of the two candidates have been submitted to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).
"We have cleared two candidates, Agnes Kagure and Dennis Waweru, and submitted their names to the IEBC,” Tuju said.
Meanwhile, ODM National Elections Board (NEB) Chairperson Mrs Catherine Mumma said the board has cleared ODM Women league president Ms Beth Syengo and former Homa Bay gubernatorial candidate Mr Sam Wakiaga for the seat.

“We need to forward the names to the party to quickly decide whether we can get the candidates to agree between themselves on who should run," Mrs Mumma told the Nation.
“That’s what we normally do so that they can have a consensus on who should go for it and if not, they are subjected for the primaries,” she further explained.
