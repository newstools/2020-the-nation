The President said women leaders would be of much help at the Senate as proposed.The President said the 2007/08 post-election violence brought in an expanded executive and it is time this was made permanent. President Uhuru Kenyatta used his Jamhuri Day address to the nation yesterday to outline what will be the main message in the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) campaigns in the New Year.
The Head of State put up a strong case for the envisaged BBI benefits, including an expanded executive to promote inclusivity, increased devolved funds to foster development in the counties, gender equity and a Judiciary ombudsman for the promotion of justice.

Unlike past national days when the President mostly dwelt on the government’s performance scorecard, yesterday’s address was largely on the BBI, what he called the First Amendment. The President pushed the need for a referendum, shutting the door on any amendments.
He also answered critics of the proposed changes, noting that “the making of a nation is not a destination, it’s a journey… and our founding fathers taught us this, by example.”





Deputy President William Ruto has been pushing for amendments where the role of women leaders would be reverted to the National Assembly and that there be multiple questions at the referendum.
The President said women leaders would be of much help at the Senate as proposed.
Expanded executive
The President said the 2007/08 post-election violence brought in an expanded executive and it is time this was made permanent.
“Our national spirit had been wounded and we were afraid of repeating the 2007 post-election violence. But, in running away from one crisis, we created another. And, now is the moment to correct this and make a shift from a constitution of fear to a constitution of hope, a constitution that ensures our nation remains stable; and therefore, attractive to both local and foreign investors,” said the Head of State.

});
}, 62000);
}



 He said the envisaged changes will cure the violence that visits Kenyans every five years during elections.
“If it takes an absurd 123 days to conduct an election or one-third of a year, like we did in 2017, this is a sign that the moment calls for change. If the country loses Sh1 trillion during these 123 days of an election, or an equivalent of one-third of our national budget, this is a sign that a moment of reckoning is approaching,” he said.
“And, if every five years we lose life and property, including our young ones, this a pointer to constitutional decay. It is a sign that the letter of our constitution has become rigid and is not in tandem with the deep-seated aspirations of our people.”
Constitutional questions
The President was categorical that BBI is not a “one-size-fits-all” that promises to settle all the constitutional questions through a singular amendment, but a starting point to a continuous process of constitution-making.
He said in an expanded executive, a nation as ethnically diverse as Kenya does not augur well for nationhood to have just two occupants at the apex of the Executive – the President and the Deputy President.
He noted the Kofi Annan consensus of February 2008, which ushered in the grand coalition government, succeeded because of an expanded executive.

});
}, 62000);
}








“Five positions at the apex of the Executive means that some people will be left out. This is why BBI proposes to re-introduce the position of Leader of Official Opposition that was so successful under the former constitutional order. An expanded Executive and constitutional recognition of the opposition will reduce the notion of ‘political scarcity’ and the propensity for electoral violence every five years,” he stated.
On devolution, the President noted that through increasing funds to counties by the national government from 15 per cent to 35 per cent, more money to the counties would mean more money to the people.
He added that creating a ward development fund will take development as close to the people as possible.
Well aware that the case of women parliamentarians being in the Senate is an issue that has caused a ruckus even from his deputy, who has termed it as tokenism, the President said women “will control half the Senate decisions”.
Strengthening devolution
“Devolution without women is like a seedless field where nothing grows. And, this is why we must ask the following question here: Who loses if women control 50 per cent of the Senate, its resources and its decisions? Is strengthening devolution through a 50:50 co-creation formula between men and women good for country? Does this formula support a constitution of fear or does it create a constitution of hope?” posed the President.

The March 9, 2018 handshake between him and ODM leader Raila Odinga, the President said, was “a temporary solution to a long-term search.”
The deputy president, in his short speech, addressed the Covid-19 pandemic that has ravaged the country for the better part of the year, calling for it to be prioritised. He used the opportunity to advance his previously stated position for a non-contested referendum.
ODM leader Raila Odinga , ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula attended the function but did not make speeches.
