We took a four-day expedition on the entire route of the 2021 World Rally Championship Safari Rally last week, a harrowing experience in some sections and exhilarating invitation of speed on others.
The final verdict? The Safari will be a hell-for-rubber excursion for the cars! Though short by over 4,000 kilometres, compared to events of 27 years ago, the Safari still retains the iconic toughness.

The route is compact but a true test for drivers alertness and reliability of cars which will need to be driven flat out without costly errors for one to finish.
The Kedong Ranch, Hells Gate, Malewa and Loldia section within a 40km radius in areas surrounding Naivasha is a journey to the unknown; Soysambu Conservancy, neighbouring Sleeping Warrior and Elmentaita routes in Gilgil are unpredictable.
The jewel of them all remains the designated Loldia “shakedown” 5km loop, 30km down Moi South road from Naivasha town. It is the complete postcard of breathtaking geographical features. It consists of plains intertwined with forested rocky patches teeming with wildlife.





It is home to buffaloes, Zebra, Giraffes and an extended family of deer, Magical Kenya images which the Safari of yore never captured on TV consistently.
This is the destination any fan loving Kenyan should venture into on the morning of June 23 next year with day-long action galore.
Loldia will offer top drivers the opportunity to drive in rally speeds to test their machines and prepare for a rigorous four days in front of the media and spectators before rally proper zooms off outside the Kenyatta International Convention Centre on June 24, followed by side-by-side start of the Safari at the Super Special stage behind Kasarani Stadium.

A simple mistake as a mere spin will alter the leadership board, these days measured in seconds as witnessed in Monza, Italy, last weekend where world champion Sébastien Ogier beat last year’s champion Ott Tanak by only 13.9 seconds.
A puncture in the Safari will be enough to drop one from pole to being completely out of contention. The general populace and an expected global television of over 70 million  people will follow the action captured on dedicated WRC+ TV channel and in linear television in over 150 countries at the shakedown as a dramatic re-introduction paragraph of the Kenya of the third decade of the 21st century.
Whereas no points are awarded in shakedown stages, it offers a sneak preview of what contenders should expect in the rally proper. Opponents weigh each other and testing the machines remain paramount.
We should congratulate Clerk-of-Course  Gurvir Bhabra and his team of Nazir Yakub — he of the minute-to-detail reputation — 2006 Africa Rally Championship (ARC) Safari Rally winning navigator George Mwangi and legendary photojournalist Anwar Sidi for a job well done.
They are not yet done with Loldia until they create a WRC Rally Finland-type concept which will see cars travel at more than 180kph crest over two jumps, taking the fastest airborne  to between 60  and 80 metres.

This will please the eyes of the fans and fire their imagination in a mouth-watering spectacle as a precursor of the high-octane rally weekend.





Whereas there is no comparison between drivers in the top WRC cars and our local ones, it will be interesting to see, as it was in the beginning, whether local knowledge will prove a major advantage for the later who will sample parts of the route in the Arc Equator Rally next April before the Safari.
