She said many other dead bodies had in the past been discovered in the abandoned quarry.
Appeal to government
Ms Gakii appealed to the government to fence off the deep pit to prevent people from easily accessing it, or drain the water out of it so that it can be covered with soil.
“The quarry was used and then left bare and water flooded it. Maybe there are other bodies trapped there," she said.
Kithunguri assistant chief Julius Kiogora said the body appeared to have been in the water for about one week since it had started decomposing.

The administrator said police from Nkubu Police Station retrieved the body and removed it to Meru Level Five Hospital mortuary. Eyewitnesses said the boy left his mother who was crashing stones and started roaming round the quarry. The residents have blamed the local authority and politicians for encouraging quarry activities without minding their safety. He served in former president Daniel Moi's cabinet. BBI secretariat cleaned up the 5.2 million signatures that endorsed the Bill, and weeded out 800,000 that had entry irregularities. This comes days after he collapsed at a hotel in Nairobi and was placed under intensive care at Nairobi Hospital.
