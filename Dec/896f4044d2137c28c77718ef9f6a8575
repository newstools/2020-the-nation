Most Kenyans don’t understand why they vote or the responsibilities of their leaders.A seminal responsibility of political parties is grooming leaders. How on earth did voters in Nairobi and Kiambu wake up early in the morning and stand in the long queues to vote in clowns? What were they thinking?
And if the two were to contest in 2022, would these voters would vote differently? I doubt it.
Mike Sonko and Ferdinand Waititu were impeached as governor of Nairobi and Kiambu County, respectively, yet they received the highest and second-highest votes, in that order, in the 2017 elections compared to their fellow country bosses.

In their book, Responsible Parties: Saving Democracy from Itself, Frances Rosenbluth and Ian Shapiro argue that the crisis of liberal democracy today, where voters are increasingly electing populist and illiberal leaders, can be explained by the fact that we have weak, small and irresponsible political parties.
Are our political parties the the problem? Do we need strong and bigger parties? Do we even have political parties in the first place? I doubt.

Good leadership
Nothing pains more than the concept of equality of vote. And, with democracy the rule of the majority, whether ignorant or informed, they will always have their way.
Yet most Kenyans don’t understand why they vote or the responsibilities of their leaders. For instance, instead of demanding of a senator sound legislation, they would ask, “How many schools has he constructed?” Do they give handouts or attend funerals?
What do we do? Limit those who vote? I believe not. All should be allowed to vote. But, to save the voter, let’s think hard about who makes a leader. This is where political parties come in handy.
A seminal responsibility of political parties is grooming leaders. They should stop polarising the country by offering to the voter clueless and incompetent candidates.

If we desire a stable and thriving democracy, parties must be at the forefront of providing good leadership. 
It is time we embarked of a serious civic education programme. We can’t achieve democracy with undemocratic citizens. 
Mr Otiato is a political scientist. brunootiato1@gmail.com. The DP's ambition to take over from his boss after the 2022 elections is a road with two paths. The decision is a blow to two aspirants who had applied to the party for sponsorship to contest the seat. This shift of focus is so dire that the World Health Organization now warns that by the end of 2020, more people will have died of malaria than Covid-19.
