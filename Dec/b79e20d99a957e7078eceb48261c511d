Missing child
Mr Mungania said the matter has been handed over to detectives in the area for investigation.
He said details available are scanty since the body is yet to be identified.
There are reports that a family reported about a missing child two months ago and there have been ransom demands.
"But until we are first ascertain that this is the child who was reported missing, everything else speculative. We will release details as they factually emerge," the Deputy County Commissioner said.
