Six suspected armed robbers were Monday gunned down during a shoot-out with police officers in Section 58, Nakuru East Sub-County.
Two others narrowly escaped with gunshot wounds following the botched robbery operation.
Nakuru County Criminal Investigations Officer Anthony Sunguti, who led the operation, said officers acting on a tip off foiled a planned robbery in Nakuru town by the armed gunmen.

He said the robbers were trailed from Nairobi after the police tracked their phone conversations.
“We received a report of a planned robbery operation within Nakuru and mobilised our officers together with the Kenya Police with a view to preventing crime. They were spotted and challenged to stop but they refused, so our officers intercepted their vehicle at Section 58 where the exchange of fire ensued,” said Mr Sunguti.

The suspects were driving a Toyota Probox car which was suspected to have been stolen from Nairobi.
Firearms recovered
Mr Sunguti said the police managed to recover an assortment firearms including a homemade gun, police pocket phone, handcuffs and several rounds of ammunition.
The DCI boss congratulated his officers for successfully challenging the heavily armed robbers.
He noted that the suspects are organised criminal gangs who are daring enough to carry out their illegal operations in broad daylight.
The police have launched investigations to establish the identities of the dead suspects as well as to bring to book the two others who escaped.
Mr Sunguti appealed to the members of the public to share any information which could help the police to arrest other criminals.
