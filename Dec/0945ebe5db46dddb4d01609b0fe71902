Carline Kennedy once remarked, “The bedrock of our democracy is the rule of law and that means we have to have an independent judiciary, judges who can make decisions independent of the political winds that are blowing.” While this is the ideal situation, in most African countries the Judiciary and Legislature are puppets of the Executive. During his four years as the head of the Judiciary, Chief Justice David Maraga proved to be an indefatigable defender of the rule of law.

Maraga, a no-nonsense man, was the first CJ in Africa to nullify a presidential re-election in August 2017. Unlike his predecessor, Dr Willy Mutunga, Maraga did not hesitate to cite glaring irregularities and illegalities during the polls.
 Although ODM leader Raila Odinga did not participate in the repeat election, the historic judgment threw the CJ into the limelight. He was loved and hated in equal measure. While some praised him for his Solomonic wisdom and jurisprudence, others condemned him for ‘selective justice’.





Fight against corruption
Reading between the lines, since the nullification of President Kenyatta’s victory, the relationship between the Executive and the Judiciary has been frosty and confrontational. This has definitely undermined the fight against corruption due to constrained financial allocation.
 A low budget to the Judiciary has proved to be a huge impediment to justice delivery hence a countrywide backlog of cases, especially those of corruption and SGBV. This has been termed as a blatant attempt to muzzle the Judiciary by the Executive.
 On the other hand, the failure by the President to appoint 41 judges approved by the Judicial Service Commission left the bench limping. This followed several public altercations between the President and the CJ.

Later, his legal opinion calling for the dissolution of Parliament over its failure to enact the two-third gender rule was ignored. Generally, Maraga performed well and will leave an indelible mark in the Judiciary.
