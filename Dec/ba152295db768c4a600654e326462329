President Uhuru Kenyatta has eulogised Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama as a distinguished and true servant of the Kenyan people.
Nyagarama died early on Friday at the Nairobi Hospital. He was 74 years old.
In a condolence message to the family, the President described Nyagarama as a friendly, approachable, wise, witty and kind leader whose contribution to the country's progress, especially in the tea sector, will be remembered.

“I have learnt with profound shock and sadness of the death of [the governor]. My family and I, and the national government send our deepest condolences and sympathies to the family and Nyamira residents," he said.
“As a nation, death has robbed us of a gifted leader whose primary mission was to transform the lives of residents of Nyamira through development initiatives,” he added.

Visionary
The Head of State said it was because of Governor Nyagarama's visionary leadership and excellent scorecard that the people of Nyamira re-elected him.
“Governor Nyagarama was a development-conscious leader who laid a firm foundation for the socioeconomic take off of Nyamira County. It is because of his progressive stewardship of county affairs that Nyamira residents gave him a second term in office," he said.
"At the national level, we shall forever be grateful to Governor Nyagarama for his contribution to the growth of our country's tea sector, where he worked for many years and left an impressive track record of success before joining active politics."
Work ethic
President Kenyatta further noted that Governor Nyagarama's success in politics, his private life and public service was largely due to his strong work ethic and relentless pursuit of excellence.

“We've lost a purpose-driven and consistent leader whose relentless pursuit of success saw him rise steadily, over the years, from a classroom teacher to one of our country's top leaders," he said.
"Nyagarama's unique ability to understand the challenges of his people and his strong work ethic propelled him to the high echelons of our country's leadership, rising to become the first governor of Nyamira County," the President said.
He prayed for comfort and fortitude for the county chief's family and the people of Nyamira.
Ruto's message
Via Twitter, Deputy President William Ruto said Nyagarama was a "selfless and formidable champion for devolution, who was genuinely dedicated to public service".
DP Ruto further described the governor as progressive, steadfast, responsive, industrious, focused and firm.
"He will be remembered as a leader who built a better, more inclusive and more transformed Nyamira," he said. His family says he had difficulty breathing after his lungs collapsed. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i was among leaders who went to Lee Funeral Home to condole with the family. His family says he had difficulty breathing after his lungs collapsed.
