Football Kenya Federation Premier League reigning champions Gor Mahia begin their title defence against Ulinzi Stars at Nyayo stadium today from 4pm.
The fixture has undergone one postponement and several venue changes in an uncertain period as FKF and four clubs including Gor  wrangle over a StarTimes broadcast rights deal with the federation.

The game was originally scheduled for November 28 but pushed back because both teams had not officially endorsed the Sh800 million seven-year StarTimes deal.
Mathare United and Zoo, who have also not signed their officially acceptance of the deal, are in danger of being expelled after yesterday’s deadline imposed on the clubs expired without them acquiescing.
FKF provisionally suspended the two clubs from the league on WednesdayUlinzi Stars were given up to Monday to sign the deal or risk being expelled too.

Gor and Ulinzi will surely be glad to take to the Nyayo field on Saturday after the Jamhuri Day celebrations.
Within a span of two days FKF had changed the day and venue, for the fixture several times.
In the revised fixture released by FKF, Gor were to play the KDF side on Saturday from 3pm at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani.
However, the match was later moved to Utalii Sports Club. Then on Thursday, FKF shuffled the match to Sunday with a 3pm kick off at Kasarani and a promotion banner was even circulated online indicating the match would be broadcast live by one of the local TV stations.
Things however changed in the evening and FKF rescheduled the fixture to Nyayo Stadium today saying the government had requested them to do so as a way of complimenting the Jamuhuri Day celebrations at the same facility.

Gor Mahia team manager Jolawi Obondo had taken issue with the way the fixture was being handled saying it was unprofessional.
“We are ready to play only it doesn’t look good if one match is rescheduled four times. It is confusing and we hope it won’t happen again because in one way or another it may affect the team’s planning,” said Jolawi.
Gor Mahia captain Kenneth Muguna said they were eager to get their title defence off to a flying start.
“It is always good to win the first match and bag the three points. Ulinzi have been tough opponents but we are fit to beat them having played in Africa. They are yet to play any competitive game and that can work to our advantage,” said Muguna.
Oliveira out
Assistant coach Patrick Odhiambo is expected to lead Gor in the match as Brazilian tactician Roberto Oliveira has been ruled unqualified by FKF to lead Gor in the Premier League.
