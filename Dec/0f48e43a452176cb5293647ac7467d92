While everyone is eagerly waiting for the end of 2020, 2021 is expected to be no better money-wise.Your son could become the next successful rapper but you are too busy to notice. During the festive season, everyone expects you to spend a lot of money. But 2020 has left a lot of people struggling financially due to the pandemic.
While everyone is eagerly waiting for the end of 2020, 2021 is expected to be no better money-wise.
This is because schools are expected to open in January while the tax reprieve we have enjoyed for the last few months is also expected to end on December 30. This means we all must be stingy with our money.

I suspect that most of us want to travel to a new place, and experience new things.
But one thing 2020 has taught us is that happiness is also to be found at home with family.
This is the time to get to know our families better.
Take time to take a walk with your son or daughter; get to know them, not just the schools they go to or the times you solved their messes but from what they do.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("desktop-article-ad-1");

Your son could become the next successful rapper but you are too busy to notice.
The festive season is all about family and friends so it is better staying at home with family than taking off alone.
School fees
People spend a lot on money jewellery, clothes and other types of presents far more than they do school fees and other necessities.
Well, what if you take advantage of clearance sales and Black Friday deals to get that pair of shoes or that watch you want to gift your son for a better price?
The quality is the same but for a lower price, the best deal for saving up for January.
One can also visit thrift shops and mitumba stalls for clothes. They offer bargains and sell very good clothes, which saves one a tidy sum of money.
We all love take-out right? What if for a change we eat home-made meals. It is both healthy and money-saving.



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-2");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});

Someone might end up spending more than Sh20,000 in a night to eat and drink in a restaurant, and spend some more on treating the children and on transport.
This would save you a lot more if you cooked your favourite meals at home, enjoyed yourselves playing games and probably take a dip at the community pool, an awesome saving hack.
Financial problems
Setting a budget; I know I should have begun with this one, but it is always better to finish strong. Set a budget of how much you want to spend and what you want to spend it on.
Having a budget ensures that you do not spend more than you can actually afford and saves you from situations that can get you in terrible financial problems.
It is better to let your family know of the budget earlier to stop them from making really expensive decisions that will make it difficult for you to meet the family needs come January.
Enjoy yourself during this wonderful time but remember to safeguard yourself and family.
