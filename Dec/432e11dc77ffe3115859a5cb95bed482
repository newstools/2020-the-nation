Political mobilisation is rapidly taking shape in the country as we embark on Constitutional amendment, a culmination of a handshake between two leading political protagonists, President Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga.
This is expected to get a notch higher as the country draws towards the 2022 General Election. Lamentably, young people, a massive political constituency in its own right, by virtue of its huge number, are yet to take a collective and organised action to at least ensure they take more leadership positions.

Youth should take up new roles and become change agents. This is the only way to build a better Kenya as they will meaningfully participate in nation building- as solution providers to all the societal needs.
In his address to The Youth Congress Youth Leagues recently, former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga aptly put it when he said that for youth to fundamentally change Kenya, they have first to accept that the crisis facing us is that of poor political leadership — enslaved by foreign interests.  It has been easy in recent years for political players to target youth in their manifestos seeking votes, but since they are not properly organised as a distinct political unit, promises are trashed after those they support ascend to power.





With 80 per cent of the country’s population below 35 years, and the latest information technology having penetrated well among the youth than the rest of the society, organising themselves along their shared experiences, needs, concerns and aspirations is not a far-fetched dream.
Multiparty politics
A distinct political unit that can pronounce itself on ideals of good governance, condemning vices such as corruption, tribalism, politics of division, greed, enslavement by foreign interests and injustices, would be a good starting point. Youth should envision contesting for political power.

Defining a new platform in which Kenyans can be socialised into politics will diminish the highly divisive ethnic politics that have defined Kenya since 1991, when we ushered in multiparty politics. It will also lay the foundation on which others such as women and labour unions can as well shape politics by bargaining inclusion.
It is impressive to see how the young people have taken the lead in other areas. They are the drivers of the private sector economy through highly advanced technologies and systems, which can be replicated with great success if applied in politics.
It is also inspiring to see many young people at the community level stand for human rights and social justices. We also have young people in civil society, in Parliament, and in places of worship. These youth leadership roles can provide beacons to open up more leadership spaces.
As we approach the General Election, young people should exercise their rights not only to vote, but to lead. Most important, youth should run for electoral office and provide alternative political leadership that the country needs. If young people are not too young to vote, they are not too young to lead.
