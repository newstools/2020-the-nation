Little-known Gogo Boys FC striker Hillary Shirao is a man on a mission.
The 21-year-old is aiming to clinch the top scorer’s award in the ongoing Kriss Darlin Super Cup in Kibra, Nairobi, to prove wrong those who have doubted his capability to excel on the pitch due to his weight.
Having won the award in the two previous editions, Shirao believes a third one in a row will see those who have looked down upon him before, because of his body size, change their perspective.

“It is another time to prove them wrong by being the top scorer,” said Shirao to Nation Sport, adding that on several occasions, top teams in the country have denied him the opportunity to attend trials due to his physique.
The burly Gogo Boys talisman says that in the local football scene, he looks up to Enock Agwanda who despite being beefy like him, has been banging goals in the top tier.





“He (Agwanda) is the man I look up to because he keeps on scoring in spite of his size. Whenever he scores, I always get the urge to keep on pushing myself to also excel,” he said.
And as the tournament, which has been held annually since 2015 enters the semi-finals round on Thursday at Woodley Grounds in Kibra, it looks Shirao will have to fight tooth and nail to succeed in his mission.
While he is at the helm of the scorers chat on eight goals, he is followed closely by four players who are tied on seven goals.
“I know it is tricky but I believe I will emerge the best,” he says adding that his target is to score 10 goals. In the 2018 and 2019 events, the 21-year-old clinched the golden boot accolade by scoring six and seven goals respectively.
Gogo Boys coach Wilberforce Chirisa tipped him to emerge the top scorer of the tournament and also help the team win their first ever title of the competition.

});
}, 62000);
}



“In my team I have five strikers but he (Shirao) is my first choice because he pushes himself so much. He always feels very bad when he misses open chances and he is also a team player. I believe in the remaining stage of the tournament, he will still be of importance to us,” said Chirisa.
Gogo Boys will face-off with Leads United in the second semi-final of the competition on Thursday. Soka Talent will square it out with Upper Karen in the first-semi-finals on Wednesday.
The winners of the tournament, whose aim is to keep youths in Kibira away from crime during the festive season, will receive a cash prize of Sh70,000. The first, second and third runners-up will pocket Sh50,000, Sh30,000 and Sh20 000 respectively.
