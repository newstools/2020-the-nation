Kenyan Railways (KR) has increased the number of trains plying the Nairobi-Nanyuki route in order to meet the holiday rush for Christmas and New Year celebrations.
The increased demand for the rail service will now see two more trains added on the route starting Friday, December 25.
This is after the available trains were fully booked Thursday, necessitating the corporation to transport the remaining passengers by the Nairobi Commuter Rail buses.

To meet the high demand, KR will therefore run a train to Nanyuki on Christmas day and two trains on December 27 and December 31, 2020 and January 2, 2021, departing at 9am from Nanyuki and Nairobi respectively.
“The corporation will run another train tomorrow, on Christmas Day, from Nairobi to Nanyuki to cater for the high demand witnessed this morning at the Nairobi Central Railway station,” said KR Managing Director Philip Mainga on Thursday.





The MD said they were overwhelmed after passengers turned up in large numbers Thursday morning at the Nairobi Central Railway Station, streaming in from as early as 6am, and by 8am, the train was full to capacity.
This triggered KR to add additional coaches and introduce an additional pair of trains during the remaining festive season.
For passenger convenience, Mr Mainga requested travellers to make their bookings a day in advance at Nairobi Central Railway station, Makadara, Dandora, Mwiki, Githurai, Kahawa, Ruiru, Thika, Sagana, Karatina, Kiganjo and Nanyuki while ensuring they carry proper identification documents.
“The service fares will remain the same with a complete trip going for Sh200 for the economy class and Sh1,000 for business class. The train will make stops at the Intermediate stations along the route which are Thika, Mitubiri, Makuyu, Maragua, Murang’a Sagana, Kiganjo and Naromoru,” he said.
