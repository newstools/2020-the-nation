Naivasha’s hospitality industry players have scaled down on incentives to clients following a business slump occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The hospitality industry has undergone a rough patch owing to the pandemic that saw hundreds of workers lose their jobs.
Naivasha-based La Belle Inns owner Mark Kariuki said they were not in a position to offer customers incentive packages due to the tough times they were going through.

In the past, hotel owners have offered clients free tours around the Hells Gate National Park and free boat rides, among other enticements, as they jostled for customers.
“Times have changed and we are now relying on the goodwill of customers for an economic turnaround,” said Mr Kariuki.    
However, he said bookings have improved in the last few days as revellers prepare to make merry.





Speaking to the Nation, a member of the Nakuru county tourism association, Mr Kimani Gitau, said the majority of hotels had recorded 70 per cent bookings.
“It is a major turnaround that also came as a surprise to us. We expected a downturn in fortunes but the changing fortunes have been remarkable,” he said.
Declining business
He further said that the majority of workers sent home due to declining business have been reinstated, and predicted better days next year.
“We are expecting more visits from foreigners which will be a big boost to an industry that has experienced worse times,” said Mr Gitau.
In February Naivasha, as a tourism destination, was put on the global map after the flower town hosted a two-day event dubbed  Naivasha Green Love Festival held at the Hell’s Gate National Park.  
The show, which coincided with Valentine's Day, was graced by renowned artists, including Tanzanian crooner Nasib Abdul aka Diamond Platnumz.

Mr Gitau admitted that the premier event was aimed at marketing Naivasha as a destination hub, terming it successful.
“We wanted to ride on the popularity of the event but the disease put paid to hoteliers’ hopes but we can see a rebound,” said the Sawela lodges MD.

As the second wave leads to a rise in infections, hoteliers have been forced to rely on skeleton staff to cut down on costs.

They have joined nurses and clinicians in their strike, a decision that will further paralyse services in public hospitals.
