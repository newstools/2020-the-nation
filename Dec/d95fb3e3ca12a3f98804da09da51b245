Despite growing momentum for boosting intra-regional trade and promoting goods and services value chains within Africa, the continent continues to rely heavily on external markets. Yet, a key socio-economic transmission channel of Covid-19’s impact worldwide has been via trade flows through supply disruptions.

Changing trends in trade linkages in the world today have widened the impact of Covid-19 on global output and reshaped the paths to recovery. 
Intra-African trade represents a small portion of the continent’s total trade. According to data from UNCTADStat, over the period 2010–2019, the share of intra-African exports of goods in Africa’s total export averaged 15 per cent while comparative regional figures for the Americas were 55 per cent, Asia 60 per cent, and Europe enjoys the highest share at 69 per cent. 





In terms of imports, intra-African trade amounts to 14 per cent of the continent’s imports, compared to much higher values for America (41 per cent), Asia (62 per cent) and Europe (66 per cent). 
Africa’s dependence on external markets for basic foods, medicinal and pharmaceutical products is particularly acute.  From 2010 to 2019, Africa imported on average about 95 per cent of its pharmaceutical product needs from the rest of the world. The equivalent figure for basic food products was 85 per cent. 
At the same time, Africa’s prospects for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), which remains an important source of financing across the developing world, is gloomy for the continent. According to the UNCTAD Investments Trends Monitor released in October 2020,  FDI inflows to Africa declined by 28 per cent in the first half of 2020.

The excessive reliance of African economies on world markets underscores their vulnerabilities, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis. According to a recent UNCTAD report on the Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on trade and development: transitioning to a new normal, Covid-19 could lead to a plunge in international trade.
In 2020, global merchandise trade volumes could drop by about 10 per cent and global merchandise trade values could fall by about 20 per cent.  
UNCTAD estimates suggest that Covid-19 could lead to a contraction of total merchandise exports from Africa by about 17 per cent leading to a 5 per cent loss in public revenues for the continent.  The pandemic is likely to push an estimated additional 31 million people into extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. Prior to the onset of Covid-19, fundamental shifts in global production networks was already underway. Value chains are getting shorter. Production is drifting to localization or regionalisation closer to the end consumer. 
FDI flows are following the pattern of going local or regional. Investment is shifting into intangibles in the rising digital revolution where Africa remains far behind the rest of the world. These are trends mainly driven by rising economic nationalism in some key trading nations, geopolitical tensions and technological changes. These trends are reaching a tipping point during the pandemic.

The consequences are that Africa needs to look local and regional today more than ever before.
Higher vulnerability
The Covid-19 outbreak and its induced restrictions suggest that dependence on remote markets increases vulnerabilities during periods of global crisis ─ such as the current health pandemic ─ which tend to lead to supply disruptions. In contrast, shorter supply chains are more likely to reduce those vulnerabilities. 
Today, Africa’s top imports, mainly sourced from the rest of the world, include agro-processed products (rice, milk, sugar); manufactured base metals (cathodes and tubes, iron and steel bars), wood, textiles and rubber products, petroleum oil and its by-products, medicinal and pharmaceutical goods. 
Most of these goods could potentially be manufactured across the continent, given Africa’s resource endowments. Yet, the fragmentation of African markets and persistent bottlenecks to trade have impeded the emergence and development of regional value chains.  Impediments to regional trade include several non-tariffs barriers such as cumbersome customs procedures and other border inefficient processes and practices including numerous and incoherent regulatory requirements. UNCTAD estimates that ad valorem equivalents of non-tariffs measures in Africa can be as high as 14 per cent for vegetables, 11.4 per cent for beverages and tobacco, 11.3 per cent for machinery and 11.1 per cent for optical and medical devices.

The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) aims at integrating African markets to address challenges emanating from the continent’s reliance on world markets. The AfCFTA has the potential to help African economies create more value in local and regional markets which in turn will help reduce vulnerabilities. Enhanced continental integration through the implementation of the Agreement will enable the economies of scale and investment necessary to develop regional value chains and support the continent’s transformational industrialization.

});
}, 62000);
}



Recent estimates from the World Bank suggest that the AfCFTA by 2035, could boost Africa’s total exports by 29 per cent, intra-continental trade by more than 81 per cent and Africa exports to the rest of the world by 19 per cent, with most of the gains accrued to the manufacturing sector. This will help increase real income of the continent by nearly $450 billion, while lifting an additional 30 and 68 million people respectively from extreme and moderate poverty.
Implementation of the AfCFTA could support continental efforts to build a stronger pharmaceutical sector by increasing its reliance on local and regional industries. This is essential for building greater resilience of Africa’s health sector to future pandemics.

Countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, Egypt, and Nigeria – to cite a few – have local industrial capacities to manufacture medicines for export to African markets, especially for generic and essential medicines. This will certainly require a more conducive policy environment in step with the AfCFTA framework, with attractive investment policies and regional medicines procurement; ease of access to resources including skills, and finance; harmonization of health and pharmaceutical regulatory frameworks at regional and continental levels. 
In this regard, UNCTAD and the WHO are collaborating on a three-year project to help build the required partnerships and guide governments on the policies required to boost the local production of essential medicines in the East African Community (EAC) and Ethiopia.
Covid-19 has delayed the start of first trading under the AfCFTA, previously planned for 1st July 2020 and now expected for January 2021. Yet, challenges faced during the outbreak of the pandemic and lessons learned suggest that momentum has to be maintained behind the implementation of the AfCFTA for deeper regional integration to build the resilience of African economies to future health crises.

}



The potential of the AfCFTA to address more than trade related issues cannot be overstated. Better integrated economies through the implementation of the Agreement will enable the levels of economies of scale and investment necessary to build capacities for the continent to produce more of what it consumes.

}



However, implementing the AfCFTA requires significant amounts of financial resources at a time when Africa is being buffeted by Covid-19. It is therefore essential for the continent to secure funding from all sources to ensure the Agreement is implemented despite the challenging context resulting from the pandemic. Combatting Illicit financial flows for example which deprive the continent of more than $88.6 billion every year could contribute to supporting the implementation of priorities towards the realization of the AfCFTA.
Putting Africa’s behind the border Agenda into national and regional perspectives, requires efforts from all stakeholders, with an interest in the development of African economies.
These range from governments, the private sector including multinationals operating across the continent, development banks (including AfDB and Afreximbank), the regional economic commissions, the African Union Commission, development partners including UN agencies and programmes, and most importantly every single African citizen.
