NOC-K advanced annual grants directly to affiliate federations totaling about Sh17 million in addition to grants to athletes of approximately Sh10 million.
This included annual monetary grants ranging from Sh100,000 to Sh500,000 to federations and other grants, such as purchase of sports equipment and support to clear sports equipment shipped into Kenya.
NOC-K has been offering federations technical support in areas such as strength and conditioning as well as support to access technical courses for administrators and coaches.





Some of the beneficiaries included the Kenya Taekwondo Association (KTA), Tennis Kenya (TK) and Kenya Hockey Union (KHU), who benefited through technical courses for coaches.
Tennis Kenya held the Olympic Solidarity technical course for 12 days from October 2 to 18 at Nairobi Club with a total of 28 participants attending the course facilitated by local expert George Oyoo, and International Tennis Federation Level III coach and Level II educator.
The KTA ran the Olympic Solidarity sponsored Taekwondo Level I, II and III technical course from November 7-9 at Kenyatta University Conference Centre.
The KHU organised the NOC-K and Olympic Solidarity funded hockey technical course from August 21 to September 10.

This informed NOC-K’s decision to purchase the world standard badminton mats for the federation for use by the elite athletes in training and preparation for major competitions. At the moment, Badminton Kenya has one Olympic Scholarship athlete, who is in the qualification pathway to Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

Badminton Kenya has in the recent years been hosting the Kenya International which is a circuit of the World Badminton Association, using borrowed mats from neighbours Uganda. NOC-K has secured an electronic scoring machine for taekwondo that is currently on the high seas.
During various consultative meetings, there was identified a dire need for an electronic scoring machine. Over the years, the KTA had relied on hire of scoring machines which was not sustainable in the long run.
NOC-K also supported its affiliates' presidents and secretaries-general by providing tickets for them to continental and international meetings. NOC-K also supported those who vied for positions in international or continental organisations.
