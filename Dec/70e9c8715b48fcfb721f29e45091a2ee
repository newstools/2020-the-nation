About 55,000 pensioners currently taking home less than Sh5,000 as pension every month will soon have access to a free comprehensive healthcare service in all public health institutions if MPs pass a report of the Labour committee currently before the House.
The report on consideration of welfare of retired officers and terms for pensioners in Kenya says the ex-workers are facing a risk of a myriad of diseases, including Covid-19.

“Despite enjoying a comprehensive medical cover while in employment, government pensioners lose the same upon retirement at 60 years. This leaves them vulnerable to a variety of ailments associated with old age,” reads the report.
“To continue enjoying benefits from the NHIF, the pensioners are expected to contribute a premium of Sh500 per month or Sh6,000 per annum. Given the low levels of pension, many pensioners are driven to extreme poverty by the burden of illness,” adds the report.





Retired public servants
Currently, the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) is managing a comprehensive medical cover for Kenya Association of Retired Officers (Karo), which covers only 1,300 retired public servants.
The public service currently has over 225,000 retirees drawing pension from the government, with the number increasing at an average of 500 retirees per annum.
The report follows a petition to the National Assembly by Karo, which wants MPs to look into ways of improving retiree’s welfare while in retirement. “These men and women have made significant contributions to national development and form an important segment of the population. They are part of the older members of society whose need for special attention and care is provided for under various Articles of the constitution,” reads the report.

National Treasury
The committee chaired by Limuru MP Peter Mwathi also wants the Labour CS Simon Chelugui in consultation with the National Treasury to include government pensioners currently earning less than Sh4,000 in monthly pension in the next listing of beneficiaries of the cash transfer for the elderly as a stop gap measure pending review of pension to reflect the current cost of living.
The two ministries have been directed to provide a progress report in parliament in March next year on the inclusion of the pensioners earning less than Sh4, 000 in the cash transfer programme.
The committee also wants the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury to initiate a comprehensive review of what the pensioners are earning to align it with constitution.
