 The President wants to expand the Executive and the Parliament by creating additional positions.It is estimated that it costs about Sh52 million to support a single Member of Parliament. According to the 2019 Census, there were 47.6 million Kenyans. The United Nations has a higher figure of 52.6 million and this variance presents a challenge to planners, analysts, and related professionals.
The Population Division of the United Nations appears to have little confidence in the government for it has continued to rely on its own projections, putting our current population at 53.8 million.

Furthermore, the United Nations shows that the country’s population has been increasing, on annual basis, by more than 1.1 million people for the past ten years.
As the year ends, more than 800,000 young people joined the job market.  At least two out of eight of these job seekers have either a university degree or a tertiary level diploma. Unfortunately, Covid-19 has been a major challenge for those trying to enter the job market.





Between 2018 and 2019, the economy added 68,400 formal jobs: 46,100 in the private sector and 22,300 in national and county governments. Sadly, the government has noted that private sector employment, often the first point of call for job seekers, was already in decline before the arrival of the coronavirus.
According to the Economic Survey, new employment opportunities in the corporate and private sector in general fell by a record 20 per cent: from 57,600 to 46,100. Thousands of Kenyans have already been rendered jobless and ongoing tough financial environment would only trigger more bankruptcies, redundancies, and layoffs.
Generate sufficient jobs
Rather than acknowledge the inability of the economy to generate sufficient jobs for millions of its young people, the government makes an outrageous claim. In the Economic Survey, it is estimated that in 2019 alone, more than 780,000 individuals were effectively absorbed into informal sector as well as self-employment.

});
}, 62000);
}



 In other words, the government assumes all these individuals were gainfully employed, even though it cannot tell us in which sectors. Granted, the informal sector is important, but it is infeasible that it could be employing that many additional people year after year.
This is nothing but an attempt by the government to gloss over a worsening employment crisis by making baseless estimates.
It is not surprising that the country’s leadership, including the President is not interested in this reality and are unconcerned by the sheer magnitude of this mounting national crisis.
But this is worth emphasising. Every year, 800,000 Kenyans are joining the workforce without any real chance of getting a job and the situation is worsening.
Let’s briefly examine the President’s response in the BBI, which is a top priority of his government and a majority of the governors. The President wants to expand the Executive and the Parliament by creating additional positions.
It is estimated that it costs about Sh52 million to support a single Member of Parliament. On the other hand, the Economic Survey shows that a Kenyan employed in the formal sector earns Sh65,000 a month.

});
}, 62000);
}



The 70 new MP slots alone would cost enough money to recruit 56,700 teachers, nurses, doctors, and other public sector employees. In total, additional zero-sum Executive and Parliamentary baggage, including hundreds of nominated MPs could easily generated 100,000 new public sector vacancies

Street protests
There is a growing admission that despite protests and opposition, the President and Raila will pursue their objective of amending the Constitution. They may have their way but when the rubber meets the road, Kenyans would no doubt express themselves more forcefully, and in far less pleasant ways.
This is inevitable given the financial difficulties that many families face today. The Treasury will soon abolish Covid-19 tax relief measures and will raise new taxes to fund the referendum and these changes. When that happens, the pain would be felt by both the passionate proponents of the BBI and those that oppose it.
The President continuously justifies his push for an expanded Executive on the need to accommodate bitter un-conceding political rivals, and to preserve peace.
For poor, jobless and hopeless Kenyans, the message is clear: take to the streets in protests, toy with treason like the swearing in of the so-called People’s President in Uhuru Park, and stay defiant. Perhaps then, someone would want to listen to your concerns and do the right thing.
