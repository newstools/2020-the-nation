Fifty four Nigerian students are feared kidnapped following an armed attack on a secondary school at Kankara in Katsina, the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari.
It is said that the gunmen invaded Government Science Secondary School close to 10pm on Friday, the day President Buhari arrived at his home for a week’s rest.

Sources said the boarding school had 884 students but that 54 were missing after the invasion by motorcycle-riding bandits.
Reports indicated that the attackers also invaded staff quarters and abducted an elderly woman.
One of the police officers manning the school gate sustained injuries and was taken to Kankara General Hospital.
The ambush forced the remaining students to vacate the school in the night.
Governor Aminu Bello Masari, who visited the school on Saturday, ordered the immediate closure of all boarding secondary schools in the state.

Mr Masari met school officials, some parents, traditional and religious leaders as well as security personnel in the area.
The governor asked the people to be patient and show restraint and understanding, assuring them that the government will do everything necessary to ensure all the missing students are found.
He said the military, police and the Department of State Security were pursuing the attackers.
Attack repelled
Gambo Isah, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of Katsina State Police Command, on Saturday said the attack was repelled.
“Yesterday, at about 9.40pm, bandits in their numbers, shooting sporadically with AK 47 rifles, attacked GSSS Kankara, Kankara Local Government Area.

“The policemen on duty responded to the attack and engaged them in a gun duel, which gave the students opportunity to scale the fence of the school and run for safety. 
“The DPO Kankara, reinforced the policemen on duty with Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) which forced the hoodlums to retreat into the forest.”
The PPRO said the police command is working with other security agencies and the school authorities to ascertain the number of students who went missing.
Isah said more than 200 learners, who ran into the town for safety, returned to the school on Saturday morning.
He said a police inspector sustained a gunshot wound and was taken to a hospital. The victims had gone to harvest their rice when they met their deaths. The insurgents seized four vehicles, including a truck and an armoured vehicle.
