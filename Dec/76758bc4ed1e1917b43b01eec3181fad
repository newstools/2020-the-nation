Security agencies and political leaders in Taita-Taveta County have moved to quell tension at the Coast Institute of Technology (CIT) in Voi following a riot by students that led to the closure of the institution last week.
Voi MP Jones Mlolwa met security officers from Voi Sub-County and a section of student leaders from the institution in a move aimed at putting to an end rising tension at the college.

The institution was closed after students took to the streets in protest against the administration.
The MP urged the students to maintain law and order as leaders and stakeholders move in to help resolve their grievances.
The students complained of a poor learning environment and failure by the administration to provide the necessary learning resources.
Following the unrest, police officers reportedly assaulted the learners.





What was planned to be a peaceful demonstration turned ugly as the students fought with police officers along the Sofia estate road.
On Monday, the CIT board held a meeting and resolved that the institution remains closed until January next year.
Online learning
In addition, the board resolved to open online learning for candidates to continue with their studies as they wait for the official opening next month.
A video posted online showing officers apparently brutalising female students at their hostels, even after the demonstration had ended and the institution closed, went viral, sparking outrage.
In one of the videos, the officers are seen beating up unarmed students and forcing them to lie down as they pour water on them.
Mr Mlolwa condemned the use of excessive force by the police and asked officers to be considerate as they enforce the law.

"As much as you want to enforce the law, you must not use excessive force that will hurt citizens," he said.
The MP will meet the college’s administration later this week to seek an amicable solution to the students’ complaints.
CIT Principal Patrick King'oina said the Monday meeting involved the board and the students’ council.
"The students were in agreement with the resolutions. We are working to ensure that we resolve their concerns," he said.
Disciplinary action
Voi Police Commander Bernstein Shari said disciplinary measures will be taken against the said officers.
"We have launched investigations into the incident and stern disciplinary action against the officers found culpable will be taken," he said.
The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) has begun investigating the matter.
Condemning the incident, Taita-Taveta Woman Representative Lydia Haika said action must be taken against officers in uniform captured in the video assaulting the female students.
Ms Haika condemned the brutality by the police officers and demanded that the concerned authorities take the necessary disciplinary measures.
"Our students suffered in the hands of the police officers during a demonstration at the institution last week and that is unacceptable," she said.

She urged women leaders to come out and condemn the incident and demand action against the perpetrators.
"We cannot remain silent when our daughters are being subjected to inhuman treatment by police. Action must be taken against these officers," she said.
