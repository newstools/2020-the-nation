Deadline for the completion of works at Sh247 million Kirubia Stadium in Tharaka Nithi County has now been extended to the end of February 2021.
Construction of the stadia began on September 23, 2016 and the project was expected to have been finished in 2017, but the government has been giving false promises to the over-anxious sportsmen and women in the region.

Kirubia is among the nine stadiums promised by President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy Dr William Ruto during 2017 General Election campaigns.
In June this year, Sports, Heritage and Culture Cabinet Secretary, Amina Mohamed, toured the facility and promised the residents that the government was set to complete and launch the stadium in a month’s time, but to no avail.
After failing to meet the deadline, Tharaka-Nithi County Development Implementation and Coordination Committee led by County Commissioner; Ms Beverly Opwora, issued another deadline of September 30, which was also not achieved.





The contractor, Toddy Civil Engineering and Construction Company site manager, Boniface Shiveka, told Nation Sport Tuesday that the earliest the work could be completed was the end of February 2021.
“I am hoping that by the end of February 2021 the stadium will be ready for use,” said Mr Shiveka.
He said he had targeted to complete the work by the end of 2020 after missing several other deadlines, but there emerged some financial issues that delayed everything.
He said government also added him some work which was in the initial contract including demolition and construction of the perimeter wall which will take almost a whole month.

The wall was built by Chuka/Igambang’ombe constituency office using National Government Constituency Development Fund earlier before the work was handed over to the national government Ministry of Sports.
The contractor is also doing the final touches on the tartan track, goal posts not erected on the football pitch, the main gate not fixed and some cabro work still ongoing.
