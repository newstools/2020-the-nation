The strike by nurses and clinical officers has paralysed health services across the country.CS Kagwe urges Kenyans to continue observing Covid-19 preventive measures during Christmas season. Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe on Saturday warned the striking health workers countrywide that they risk being sacked.
Kagwe told nurses and clinical officers who have paralysed health services across the country to call off the strike and go back to work if they want to keep their jobs.
Speaking at Kamutungi village in Mbeere South Constituency during the burial former Cabinet Minister, Joe Nyagah, Mr Kagwe noted that the health workers have kept away from their places of work even after the court stopped the strike.

Mr Kagwe told counties to start advertising the jobs of the striking health workers.
"The counties should start recruiting new health workers to replace the ones on strike," he said.
Mr Kagwe said that currently there are 8,000 nurses who are at home due to lack of jobs.
"If the striking workers continue being adamant, the nurses who are at home without jobs should be employed," he said.

Kenyans suffering
The CS lamented the suffering the strike by the health workers has subjected many Kenyans in need of healthcare.
"No health services are being delivered in many hospitals and Kenyans are really suffering. Those who have boycotted duties should resume work or face the sack," he warned.
At the same time, Mr Kagwe urged Kenyans to continue observing Covid-19 preventive measures during Christmas season.
"Kenyans should continue wearing masks, washing hands regularly and avoiding crowded places to be safe. Covid-19 is a dangerous disease and is not sparing even the mighty," he said.
He said the disease is spreading fast in all the counties across the country.
"We don't want to continue losing lives to this disease, I therefore urge all Kenyans to adhere to  control measures put in place by the government," he said.

} Most public hospitals are asking relatives of patients to take them elsewhere as all departments remain shut. County says the new promotions show goodwill of Governor Josphat Nanok. Mr Nyagah was 72 when he died of coronavirus at Nairobi Hospital last week. Mr Odinga termed the meeting as "symbolic" and meant to ensure that the two communities work together.
