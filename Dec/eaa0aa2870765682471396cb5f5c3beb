The alleged abduction of three male relatives from Athimba area of Kanuni in Igembe South, Meru County, took a new twist with callers sending families in an harrowing wild goose chase. 

The families of Joseph Giteme, Charles Kalung'e and Bernard Miriti said they had received disturbing calls that their kin could be dead, and could have been the unidentified bodies of three persons collected in Tigoni area of Limuru.

Initial scrutiny through close contacts indicated that they were not the ones, although the family planned to travel to Kiambu on Wednesday (today). 

Mr Giteme is a person of interest in the attempted murder of lawyer Kirimi Mbogo and is facing a trial in a different matter that led to the injured lawyer and three witnesses being placed under witness protection agency after expressing threats to their lives.

Mr Giteme is charged with giving false information to a person employed in the public service contrary to section 129 (a) of the Penal Code.

Mr Mbogo was shot in the same week the case was revived after having been terminated in 2016 by a Director of Public Prosecutions officer. 

Other witnesses had developed cold feet after Mr Mbogo was shot and injured. 

Mr Miriti, 31, is Giteme’s step-brother, while Mr Kalung’e, 58, is his wife Purity Makena’s uncle. 

But before they made the trip, they received a call ostensibly from Shimo la Tewa that they were being held there awaiting arraignment for an unspecified crime. 

The caller, who identified himself as a remand prisoner from Meru, claimed that the three appeared to have been beaten up, and appeared to be in bad shape.

The man said he was being held at the maximum-security facility after he allegedly caused a fatal vehicular homicide and had made contact with the three after realising they were from Meru.

However, Kanuni MCA Josephat Mugambi, who received the call in presence of the family members, said an independent scrutiny indicated that the call may have been placed from within Maua town. 

“The call came as residents had asked me that we hold a demonstration over the abduction. He said he saw them as they took fingerprints and were about to be taken to the police station. We reported the incident at Maua police station but they have not given us any feedback many hours later,” he said. 

Demonstrations held 

Mr Mugambi later joined hundreds of residents who clashed with police as they held demonstrations over the disappearance of the three men. 

Police were forced to fire tear gas canisters as they were overwhelmed by the mob that pelted them with stones in Antubochiu area. 

The group had walked for over 10 kilometres to the Modern area of Maua town intending to storm the local police station but turned back on being informed that their demonstration was illegal. 

The MCA, together with Ms Makena said Mr Giteme, had reported to the police that he was being trailed by people who claimed to be police officers, a day before he went missing.

}, 62000);

The government should tell us where they are. 

Ms Makena claimed that friendly police officers from Maua and Kanuni had approached occupants of the vehicle that was trailing Mr Giteme and they had reported that the occupants were true, undercover police officers.

“We have gone to the county commander of police, Maua and Meru police but no response is forthcoming. The government should tell us where they are since the DCI officers who went there and said they were government officers should have identified them through their service numbers,” said Mr Mugambi. 

Ms Makena said the twist in the disappearance saga had caused anxiety in the family. 

Police in Meru have also released a Toyota Probox in which the three were traveling on the day they went missing. 

The vehicle was dusted for fingerprints and documents belonging to Mr Kalung’e handed over to his family. Giteme is a person of interest in the attempted murder of lawyer Kirimi Mbogo. In the past six months, 10 people have been reported missing, only to be found dead. According to Kampala Archbishop, politicians are not following Covid rules. Her 12-year-old son survived after managing to swim to safety. The group said it had taken the chief prisoner during an attack on a Kenyan police outpost.
