“Requests for training venues shall be lodged with the office of the Commissioner for Sports for further processing. Strict facility use priority will be granted to Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Team Kenya," the CS added.
The Naivasha conference also laid down proposals for a more effective approach to media operations to Team Kenya in Tokyo, including putting together a strong communications team that will give the Kenyan narrative.
"The Ministry in conjunction with NOC-K and KNPC (Kenya National Paralympics Committee) will launch a Team Kenya communication and public relations training programme to educate athletes on general Japanese Culture, etiquette, interviewing skills and media response strategies to amplify Team Kenya and individual athletes’ branding," she explained.
Additional focus will also be given to anti-doping protocols and procedures with a proposed elaborate anti-doping programme "which will be maintained and resourced without any compromise to secure effective and efficient participation of Team Kenya without medical and anti- doping glitches."
NOC-K and the ministry considered recommendations of the Rio 2016 Olympics Probe Committee that was constituted by the government to investigate Kenya’s mismanagement of the 2016 Games in Brazil.
