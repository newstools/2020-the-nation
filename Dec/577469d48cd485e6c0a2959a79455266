Let’s remain focused on changing perceptions, one game at a time.Third, is for the fact that despite the fact that progress is slow, the world has recorded some gains in the women’s game this year. According to His Holiness the Dalai Lama, there are two ways to reach contentment. One is to acquire everything we want and desire, the other is to feel grateful for what we already possess.
The first option involves finding the means to acquire all our desires – an expensive car, a beach house, the perfect body…the list is endless.



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-1");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



The problem with this approach is that sooner or later one will realise that there are things he can’t buy or make happen, which could lead to serious discomfort.
The second approach, the more reliable one, involves being content whether we obtain the objects of our desire or not.
That’s why, this Christmas day, I choose to be grateful despite all the failures and the challenges that still lie ahead.
First, I am thankful that the ball has been set rolling on this season’s Kenya Women’s Premier League.





One round has already been played despite the damaging effects that the coronavirus pandemic has had on sports globally, and for that I am grateful.
May we witness fewer walkovers this season, fewer cases of nonpayment of players and coaches and fewer issues of players abandoning their passion due to frustration.
Second, I am thankful for the champions, advocates and researchers of women’s football all over the world, including my good friend Jean Sseninde, a former Uganda international who has since retired from the game to offer her expertise in women’s football management in the continent on full time basis.
Although the climb remains steep for all who champion for equality in football and sports in general, your efforts are valuable.

Third, is for the fact that despite the fact that progress is slow, the world has recorded some gains in the women’s game this year.
This year, the Brazil FA agreed to pay men and female national team players equally, paving way for more federations across the world to follow suit.
The Confederation of African Football has also established the champions league tournament for women’s football clubs, a move that is bound to improve the standards of the game as well as the competitiveness of local women’s clubs.
Special; gratitude goes to federations such as the South Sudan FA, the youngest member of the world governing body Fifa, for rolling out a clear roadmap for the development of the women’s game in the country.
Your catch-me-if-you-can notice to the rest of the continent is clear, and I can’t wait to see how that plan will transform the women’s game in your country.
I am also grateful to my bosses for seeing it worthy to have this platform to discuss the women’s game every week. With time, this discourse will certainly rise higher up the chain, translating to better representation of female athletes.
As we count down the last few days of the year, I challenge you to make a commitment to do something significant to increase equality in the football world.



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-3");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-3']]);
});
}, 62000);
}






if (shouldRenderAd(false)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("desktop-article-ad-2");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



In your own small way, do something to support the women’s game. Purpose to attend one premier league match, watch a game involving women on Super Sport, or if you can, donate list and equipment to a women’s team. It will still count as a contribution if you encourage a little girl around you to pursue her passion in football.
I wish you all a merry Christmas and a prosperous new year!
