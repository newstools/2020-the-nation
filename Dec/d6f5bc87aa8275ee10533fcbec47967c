Christmas is one of the most awaited holidays of the year.
But this year’s Christmas will be remembered for the killer coronavirus.
But even then, the Covid-19 pandemic could not stop the traditional merry-making and family tradition of catching up and having quality time.
Despite thousands of deaths being reported worldwide on the very day Kenyans marked the birth of Jesus Christ, cheer and laughter could be heard from homes in my neighbourhood.

Christmas carols rent the air and children played carefree — a day of joy to suppress the gloom that most Kenyans have experienced throughout this year.
Near our home, butcheries, supermarkets, kiosks, wholesalers and bakeries recorded booming business.
Besides serving walk-in customers, many delivered goods and services to homes as people’s spending defied the virus that has so far claimed more than 1.8 million lives worldwide.





“Share with those in dire need,” a local pastor preached during our Christmas church service.
After church, I was overjoyed to see his advice being heeded to and humanity clearly showing as neighbours shared the little they had with the community.
Video and phone calls were utilised to their full capacity as families did their best to keep in touch with one another.
Nobody should feel lonely.
But on a sad note, some Kenyans decided to take risks and make merry in crowded places.
This was quite unfortunate. It is unfair for a few individuals to roll back the gains we have achieved as a country in the fight against coronavirus.
As we speak, many are in fear of a possible fresh corona explosion in January because of these bad manners.
This should not be allowed to happen again.

As we continue celebrating and preparing to usher in 2021, let us honour the hard work and sacrifices made by our health workers in the war against Covid-19.
Wear a mask, sanitise, avoid crowds and always keep distance.
Happy New Year!
