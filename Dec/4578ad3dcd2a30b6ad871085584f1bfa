Or as the French say, an elephant in a porcelain store.
By forcing the StarTimes deal down the throats of all and sundry, the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) President is dealing a major dent on the corporate image of an otherwise well-meaning Chinese pay television concern.

In essence, he is biting the hand that feeds him.
Events of last Saturday at the Nyayo National Stadium threw the spanner in the works.
In an attempt to contain Gor Mahia's dissent over the much-trumpeted StarTimes deal, FKF decided to lock out journalists who were deemed to be sympathetic to the record 18-times Kenyan league champions' cause, and “who would have live-streamed and documented K’Ogalo’s match in contravention of the StarTimes deal.”
Journalists who have worked tirelessly to enhance the Kenyan game, including colleagues from the Nation Media Group and Royal Media Services, were hounded out of the venue, like common criminals, by the police.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {

});
}, 62000);
}



The "crime" these journalists — who included senior Citizen TV Sports Editor Mike Okinyi, also the Secretary General of the Sports Journalists’ Association of Kenya — had committed was simply doing their professional job of showing up at the stadium to update audiences on the progress of a league they love so much.
Death knell being sounded
The last time I checked, newspapers don’t live-stream matches and it defeats us why our writers and photographers were locked out!
Granted, the other league matches countrywide went without incident, but if what happened at Nyayo on Saturday goes unmitigated, then the death knell is surely being sounded on corporate interest in Kenyan club football.

Global condemnation followed Saturday's incident with International Sports Press Association President Gianni Merlo rightly stressing that journalists' rights and freedoms must be respected.
StarTimes themselves dug in and stressed the need for respect for media professionals who are key players in sports partnerships.
Mwendwa seems to be crying louder than the bereaved, and this is bad publicity for a league badly struggling for attention.
Mwendwa has adopted a divide and rule strategy to gain favour from clubs, and has stretched the same to the media where select, “blue-eyed” scribes get his nod.
Clubs like K’Ogalo, Mathare United, Zoo Kericho and Ulinzi Stars have raised pertinent issues about the StarTimes deal that need to be considered.
Incidentally, Mwendwa's alter ego is that of an individual passionate about football development, one that has gone to great lengths to secure a sound financial base for the sport.
One that has dumped boardroom suits for tracksuits in solidarity with players.
At FKF, he has managed to put together solid management structures that were erstwhile lacking, and that have seen the development of, inter alia, a vibrant and effective communication department, led by the indefatigable Ken Okaka.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {

});
}, 62000);
}



Which goes to show that FKF value the importance of communication and know they can’t do without it.

“Nick” should not be averse to criticism, and must desist from unwarranted harassment of the media, as this will certainly be his downfall.
He should listen more and talk less, for the good of the game. After all, there have been many federation presidents before him, and many more will come after, for there's no individual bigger than the beautiful game of association football.
Not even Fifa President Gianni Infantino.
Often, Kenyan media is roundly condemned for focusing too much on the English Premier League and other well-organised competitions like the Uefa Champions League.
But with such treatment visited on local scribes by an arrogant federation, who would bother risking a limb to cover domestic competition?
Our matter is currently in the hands of the Media Council of Kenya who will advise on the way forward. In the interim, the blackout on all FKF leagues and activities remains in full force.
Meanwhile, I can’t wait for competitions that show respect for media to kick off... Like the annual Koth Biro Cup that lights up Ziwani every year.  
Here, we don’t risk intimidation by FKF police!
