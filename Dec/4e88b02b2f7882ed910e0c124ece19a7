The event gave the Kenyans a good stage to accumulate points to qualify for the Olympics.
Each player has accumulated points with those reaching semifinals having earned 216 points towards the Olympic qualifying.
"We are hopeful that cumulatively they will be able to qualify for the Olympics, having been left with six qualifying events which end in May next year," said the team manager Duncan Chemiryo noting that Kenya's high ranking players are short of 468points, which is possible to get if they get the chance to participate in the upcoming events.
Kenya hopes to send judokas for the next Olympic qualifying event in Doha on January 13-14 followed by Poland on February 26-28.

Kenya Judo Federation president Shadrack Maluki noted that it was tough for his players considering that the sport was considered high risk as the world battled the Covid-19 pandemic.
"We didn’t get good time to train but the two weeks we were allowed to train the national team under strict conditions helped get the above results," said Maluki adding that given more time and facilitation to compensate lost time during this Covid-19 period, they can post better results in the subsequent qualifiers.
Maluki appreciated the support they received from the Ministry of Sports to have the team attend the event in Madagascar.
"They did what they could during these hard times to ensure we participated but also got closer to qualifying. It’s this moment that we have to appreciate the government," said Maluki. The African Union Commission has called for dialogue, citing Nairobi’s contribution of troops to Amisom and the hosting of refugees. Regional leaders are expected to hold a meeting in Djibouti Sunday. The ANC leader has warned of a possible paralysis in the public service if primary focus remains on the BBI.
