“We are partnering with a group known as Fashion For Fighters Foundation which supports ill and wounded former soldiers. Part of the proceeds from the event will go to their kitty,” Korir said during the launch of the tournament.
“We realised that we could not import most of the things we need because of the Covid-19 pandemic, so we had to become innovative and manufacture our own materials. We decided to build ‘Brand Kenya’ and the best way to do this was to partner with Rivatex who manufacture fabrics locally,” he said.





Eldoret Club Golf captain Godffrey Kitiwa said the first tee off will be at 7:30am while the prize giving ceremony will start at 5:30pm.
“As the captain, I want to thank the sponsors of the event, Leletsa Fashion. The tournament will mark the last event in our calendar this year, although our calendar ordinarily concludes at the end of March,” said Kitiwa.
“Times have been very hard due to the Covid-19 pandemic and we have not had much sponsorship. That is why I am thankful to the sponsors of Saturday (today’s) tournament.”
