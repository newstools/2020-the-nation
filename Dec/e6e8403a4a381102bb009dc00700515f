Certificate of roadworthiness
However, vehicles from countries where Kebs has an inspection agency, including Japan, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Thailand, Singapore and South Africa shall be expected to be accompanied with a certificate of roadworthiness (CoR) issued by the agencies appointed by Kebs.
“It is further clarified that certificates of roadworthiness for vehicles whose year of first registration is 2013 will not be valid after December 31, 2020,” Kebs noted.

The bureau said it had received petitions that Covid-19 pandemic might have affected some importers due to disruption of shipping schedules.
“Therefore, Kebs wishes to inform such importers to lodge all the necessary supporting documents to prove the impact of the pandemic to their shipment before a waiver can be considered,” said the bureau. However, the documentation should be received by December 28.
“This only applies to vehicles that had been purchased, inspected and issued with a certificate of roadworthiness on or before December 1, 2020 and which are likely to arrive into the country after the cut-off date of December 31, 2020,” the notice stated.
