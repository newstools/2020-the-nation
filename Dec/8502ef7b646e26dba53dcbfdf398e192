"After resting we shall have a pre-match conference with our hosts and then feel the pitch. We are confident of a good result and are sure we shall achieve that given that most of our players are experienced in this competition. Having more than 12 hours to prepare for the game is also good for us," added Odhiambo.
Gor will miss the services of injured captain Kenneth Muguna,Â  defender John Ochieng and striker Nicholas Kipkirui who didn't travel with the team.
Muguna is still nursing ankle injury he suffered in the second leg of Caf Preliminary round clash against APR of Rwanda. Gor edged out the Rwandan record champions 4-3 on aggregate.
Ochieng on the other hand is yet to feature for Gor in any competition since joining from the disbanded Chemelil Sugar in August.
Kipkirui told Nation Sport he had family engagements which couldn't be postponed and even received the blessings of the club managers.
