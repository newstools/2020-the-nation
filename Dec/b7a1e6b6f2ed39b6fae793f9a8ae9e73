During the period under review, the number of ATMs decreased by 2.77 percent to 2,459 in December 2019 from 2,529 in December 2018 as customers increasingly turn to agency, internet and mobile banking.
The number of bank branches also decreased from 1,505 in 2018 to 1,490 in 2019, which translated to a decrease of 15 branches. Nairobi County registered the highest decrease in the number of branches by 8 branches.
