ODM, in the early days of the campaigns, pushed back on attempts to frame the contest as one between Mr Odinga and the DP, instead deploying Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho to lead the party’s campaigns.
The DP also avoided venturing into Msambweni and instead left it to his allies such as Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, Nyali MP Mohammed Ali, and former senators Hassan Omar and Johnstone Muthama, to campaign for Mr Feisal Bader.





Mr Joho teamed up with Kilifi governor Amason Kingi to campaign for the ODM candidate, Mr Omar Boga, in the quest by the orange party to recapture the seat that fell vacant following the death of Mr Suleiman Dori.
