Due to delays in getting their pay, most staff have resorted to taking expensive mobile loans.Mr Ntuchiu lamented that the National Treasury is holding close to Sh2 billion in disbursements for October, November and December. County workers are staring at a black Christmas as some of them are yet to receive previous months’ pay due to a cash crunch.
The Council of Governors recently lamented that the National Treasury was holding onto Sh78 billion meant for the counties since September, effectively grounding their operations.

In Nandi County, 4,106 workers have gone without pay for three months.
Some who spoke to the Nation said they are being asked by landlords to vacate their rented houses over non-payment of rent.
"For three months we have not received our salaries," said Hillary Koech, a worker with Transport department.
"Life is becoming unbearable because we cannot meet our needs," said Matilda Jerop, another worker.
On Friday, the deputy governor Dr Yulita Mitei led county workers in asking National Treasury to ensure they are paid salaries without delays.





"Workers in Nandi County are going home without salaries and they fear that when schools open in January, they might not have money for school fees," said Dr Mitei.
Expensive mobile loans
Due to delays in getting their pay, most staff have resorted to taking expensive mobile loans.
Governor Stephen Sang blamed the lack of funding to the national government’s misplaced priories, such as popularisation of the Building Bridges Initiative at the expense of the devolved units.
"As we speak, workers in the county and more so health workers who have sacrificed their lives over Covid-19 have not been paid," said Governor Sang.
In Murang’a, county workers fear that they may have to spend Christmas and New Year broke after a notice last Wednesday informed them that there is no money to pay November and December salaries.

In an internal memo to staff dated December 16,  the county government blamed its inability to pay salaries on time on the Covid-19 pandemic and delayed disbursement of funds by the national government.
The memo, however, commits that the county administration will make arrangements to pay the November salaries before Christmas.
“This is very sad for us,” said a casual employee who sought anonymity for fear of victimisaton. “Salary payments have been very erratic and sometimes we have experienced four months delays. Treating staff, who have families, in this manner is equivalent to torture.”
In Meru, deputy governor Titus Ntuchiu, who is also the finance executive, said they had approached banks for an overdraft to pay workers before Christmas.
Mr Ntuchiu lamented that the National Treasury is holding close to Sh2 billion in disbursements for October, November and December.
He said borrowing from banks was an expensive option.
“We are charged between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent interest on the overdraft, hence a payroll of about Sh400 million can attract interest of about Sh10 million. This is why we borrow the net salary, leading to delays in remitting statutory deductions,” Mr Ntuchiu explained.

The deputy governor expressed concern that banks had become cautious about lending to the county and were still in talks to ensure workers are paid before Christmas.
Mr Ntuchiu said the delayed disbursement of money has stalled development programmes with contractors also getting jittery about taking up projects.
“I am always writing letters to banks pleading on behalf of contractors who risk being auctioned due to delayed pay. Unless we get disbursements for October, November and December, we cannot afford any development project now,” the finance executive said.
Workers in Embu and Kirinyaga counties complained of similar woes.
Christmas without money
"How does the government expect us to celebrate Christmas without money?" one of the workers in Kirinyaga asked.
In Nyeri County, finance executive Robert Thuo said that the December salaries are likely to be paid by the end of next week.
“I would not like to give a specific date because it is a process but we are processing the salaries and by the end of next week we will have paid them in full,” he says.
The county government pays salaries of up to Sh320 million a month.
In Tharaka Nithi County, Finance executive Dorothy Igoki said the devolved unit has not received disbursement for the months of October, November and December.
