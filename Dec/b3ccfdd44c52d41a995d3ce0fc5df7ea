Twenty years ago, MSF was the first organisation to bring ARVs to a public health facility in Kenya.Globally, millions of people lost their lives before the battle was over, but in the end HIV drugs eventually became available because of the defeat of the pharmaceutical monopolies. The news the world was anticipating finally broke: A vaccine against Covid-19 is now a reality. Unfortunately, the news that made the western world cheer and stock markets skyrocket, did not give people in poorer countries the same reason to jump for joy.
Rich countries have, on one hand, grabbed most of the available vaccines for themselves by pre-ordering some 80 per cent of the doses and, on the other hand, blocked a measure that could enable other parts of the world to provide for themselves: A patent waiver on all Covid-related products and vaccines for as long as the pandemic is ongoing.

The groundbreaking proposal was put forward by India and South Africa, co-sponsored by Kenya, before the Trips Council of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
The suggestions propose that no WTO member will issue or enforce patent protections on vaccines, drugs, technology or equipment needed to combat Covid-19 for the duration of the pandemic.





Without patent restrictions to protect pharmaceutical profits, it may be possible – and affordable – for low-income countries to produce vaccines and treatment for their people.
Pharmaceutical industries
Sadly, rich countries with strong pharmaceutical industries are not supporting this move. They claim that without patents, the incentives to develop new drugs, treatments and vaccines will disappear.
 Others point to measures they claim will allow low-income countries access to the vaccine. But they fail to admit that none of these measures go far enough to ensure the low-income countries equal access to their share of future vaccines or drugs against Covid-19.
The proposal from India and South Africa, however, would have real impact. India has not been called “the pharmacy to the world” for no reason.
They have both the capacity and the technology to be able to mass-produce complex biological drugs. Patent laws are not laws of nature. They are contracts between states and industries. People have designed them – and people can reform them.

Pharmaceutical monopolies
In Kenya, and in many countries across East Africa, we know first-hand the cost of pharmaceutical monopolies. Twenty years ago, MSF was the first organisation to bring ARVs to a public health facility in Kenya.
The move followed a global campaign to bring down drug prices through generic production, launched when we were struggling to assist HIV patients who were left to die whilst people in rich countries had access to ARVs.
Globally, millions of people lost their lives before the battle was over, but in the end HIV drugs eventually became available because of the defeat of the pharmaceutical monopolies.
Today we are calling on countries to listen to the experience of the HIV/Aids epidemic and come together to support this bold patent waiver proposal.
Countries across East Africa should share their experience and ask their international partners – those in countires that are not supporting this gamechanging move – to support this proposal. We should support initiatives that will empower countries to be able to face future crises without being at the mercy of aid.





Now is the time to raise our voices to support a proposal that represents a real chance for people whose lives are threatened by a pandemic we face a long struggle to defeat.

Instead, the WTO and wealthy countries across the world contribute to maintaining the victim role of low-income countries with their refusal to support this waiver.
The patent waver proposal will be discussed again at the WTO TRIPS Council on Thursday 10 December. MSF asks governments across the world to practice the solidarity they preach.
Now is the time to raise our voices in support for a proposal that represents a real chance for people whose lives are threatened by a pandemic we face a long struggle to defeat.
