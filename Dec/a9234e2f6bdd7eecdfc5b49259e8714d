There is a lot about the current situation with Covid-19 that is frightening and unknown. However, there are also some extraordinary opportunities to do things differently – and do them better.
One of the important areas in which we could use the current situation as an opportunity to do better is in structuring our societies around gender.

The virus itself is not interested in gender, but the impact of social and economic responses to the virus are inextricably linked to gender.
The pandemic has exacerbated gender inequalities that predispose women to violence. Even in ordinary times, gender-based violence (GBV) remains an existential crisis which has just been made worse by the impact of the pandemic.
Domestic violence cases
As the world continues to grapple with the devastating falling-out of the pandemic, there is recorded upsurge of domestic violence cases. The stay-at-home orders and closure of schools coupled with the economic and health stressors have forced survivors already at risk of domestic abuse into even more vulnerable and dangerous positions.

});
}, 62000);
}



The stigma associated with the vice and the secrecy surrounding it prevents victims from reporting cases, making it difficult to paint an accurate picture of the prevalence and severity of gender violence overall.
Available but fragmented data from counties and across the country indicate that almost every county has reported an increase in gender-based violence. While the reports also show that there has been an increase in the number of cases reported by men and boys, the overall data on cases reported by children had risen to 11,448 as at October 2020. This is according to the Kenya Health Information system.

});
}, 62000);
}



If closely mirrored with the accounts of many victims who chose not to go public about their ordeals, the numbers could be higher, indicating that many survivors facing the threat of continued or escalating violence were unable to find space or time away from an abuser to reach out for help, or else saw no hope or available solutions.
Invest in safe houses
Unfortunately, in Kenya, there is only one government owned safe house, established in Makueni by the county government. All other available shelters are privately owned and are grappling with funding constraints. In addition, they have limited spaces and can hold a limited number of people simultaneously.
This has left a gap in the safety and security of survivors, especially children who are often held in police cells or juvenile detention centres. The double jeopardy of being a victim of gender-based violence and being held in close proximity with those in conflict with the law cannot be gainsaid. 
What needs to be done
The current crisis then shines a spotlight on the overriding inadequacies of the very systems intended to support survivors and to prevent or mitigate GBV itself. There is need for an improved system of survivor support that will ensure gender-based violence programmes and safe houses are set up and receive sufficient funding during the pandemic and in future.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-3']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



In addition, there is need for a broader continuum of care and safety that prioritises the needs of sexual and gender-based violence survivors. This includes considering the differing experiences of survivors across communities and building solutions that are culturally competent.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



The interventions needed to create a robust infrastructure of support must centre on the experiences of survivors throughout the healing process. Support infrastructure must feature interventions that adopt strong prevention measures to disrupt violence in its earliest forms, minimise economic barriers to services and overall economic costs on survivors, create strong support systems focused on health and safety, tackle the root causes of violence and build a network of trained professionals to assist survivors along the way and stop illegal and toxic behaviour.
We must endeavour to build a proactive infrastructure that prevents these abuses from occurring by ensuring that perpetrators are held accountable.
An infrastructure that responds only after an incident has occurred, rather than focusing on building a reliable care and safety network, is an infrastructure that fails survivors.
When effectively implemented and strongly backed, a robust support infrastructure helps to ensure survivor’s safety, health, and economic security.

As the country contends with the negative economic and health effects of the pandemic, simply pushing to reopen and resume daily activities is not the comprehensive solution for survivors or the public in general. Not only is the coronavirus pandemic still a very real threat that could require future lockdowns to control the spread of the virus, but a return to business as usual will do little to address the gender-based violence crisis. In fact, business as usual has long been inadequate for survivors, even before this pandemic.
It is critical to develop bold structural solutions to address underlying issues on gender violence, particularly against women in order to prevent future violence, both as an immediate concern and as a means to improve support structures for survivors into the future.
