Seven has their seafood regularly brought in from the coastSome of the menu items were rather priceyThe pairings must have been studied for years in a lab because they just always work I had a meeting the other day and the other party suggested we grab lunch at Seven Seafood & Grill. I hadn’t been there in a few years, so I was definitely keen to go back. When we got there we got a table on the outdoor terrace; I find that the indoor space lends itself more to evening dining. There were two hosts at a station by the entrance and I found them to be really helpful.

Now one wouldn’t expect to find such a variety of really fresh seafood in Nairobi, but Seven has theirs regularly brought in from the coast.  I found some of the menu items rather pricey, such as the slipper lobster risotto pan seared in garlic then tossed through a delicate risotto fragranced with capers and parsley, finished with cream. The cost? Sh2,250. From the butcher’s block section, their 21 day aged, range-fed Borana Angus steaks are prime, and the prices reflect that. A 400g rib eye chop aged for 28 days for Sh3,295, a 500g T-bone for Sh3,700, and the cheapest priced from that sectionat Sh1,800, the 24 hour slow cooked beef short ribs finished with a sweet and sticky honey & soy jus.






I however had seafood on my mind, and everything looked tempting. To start, we got the salt n pepper squid served with a wasabi mayo to share from the starter section, for Sh1,250. I got this because it seemed like the only item in that section that didn’t have any flour batter added to it, but when it got to the table, I realised I had been mistaken. Still, I had a couple of the rings and if this was a teaser for what’s next, I was on the edge of my seat with excitement.

For the mains, I ordered shellfish. I would later stop myself from sending a picture to my grandma. Last time I was in Watamu, I showed her a picture of a whole crab I had ordered and let’s just say that she is yet to recover from it, bless her heart. The menu listed giant tiger prawns with your choice of basting and side, priced at Sh1,600 per 100g. Now we were not sure how much meat this meant when it came to prawns, and ultimately ended up with two 140g prawns. You can order more or less, and I suppose the listed price adjusts to reflect that. I selected the garlic butter basting, with other choices being smoked paprika. This pairing must have been studied for years in a science lab because it just always works. My side was a grilled highland cabbage which surprisingly came in a sweetened sea of soy sauce. I found it too sweet for my palate. I would have never thought to grill cabbage though...our traditional Kenyan recipes can borrow a thing or two from this.
