Former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has resurfaced after a yearlong political hiatus. 

The man who was successfully impeached one year ago is now eyeing the vacant governor’s position in Nairobi. 

 Seven years ago, the controversial politician, fondly known as Babayao, gunned for the city governorship but lost to Dr Evans Kidero with a 22,000 vote margin.

Impeached Kiambu Governor Waititu speaks on Nairobi gubernatorial by-election

Decked out in a cowboy’s hat, a short-sleeved white shirt, beige chinos and brown oxford shoes, the controversial politician rationalised his sudden decision to fill the void left by impeached city governor Mike Sonko. 

Despite spending long hours a year ago in the courts and the offices of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, Babayao on Monday left no doubt that he has his eyes firmly on City Hall. 






“I grew up in Nairobi. This is where I studied, it is where I hustled in my youth. I have also been a councillor here, a deputy mayor, Embakasi MP and even vied for the governorship in 2013. This is my home, my background, I know all its corners,” he said at the Michuki Memorial Park in Nairobi. 

Armed with a smile on his face and a glint bouncing off his gold watch, Mr Waititu seems to have shaken off his beleaguered past surprisingly fast. The only regret he claims to still harbour from that troubled past is his failure to keep the promises he made to the people of Kiambu. 

“It is true I was impeached almost a year ago. But all these accusations came from my adversaries, the “kieleweke” team, which tagged me an enemy of the President. They were all lies,” he said.

“No one can stop me from vying for any political seat. I have never been convicted of any crime, leave alone been jailed for six months. 

My case is ongoing. I have appealed. For now, I am like every other ordinary citizen,” he said. 

He likens his case to that of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto, who were elected to political posts yet they still had cases to answer in The Hague.

Asked whether he still enjoys the company of old friends from his governorship days, he was a bit evasive: “I have been focusing solely on business in the past one year. My concern was my business partners and colleagues. Those with whom we could help each other.” 

And he is vying on an independent party ticket as he no longer believes in the Jubilee Party, which he ardently campaigned for in 

2017 and backed until last year. 

“No one wants to vie on the Jubilee ticket because if you try, you will fail. Kenyans have woken up, they are now electing leaders because they personally know them, not because of parties,” he said. 

His only sin, he believes, was his firm support for DP Ruto, whom he considers to be the mother of Jubilee Party and President Uhuru the father. 

 The March 2018 handshake between Mr Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, he says, is akin to the “other wife” coming in to destabilise a stable, blessed family.

 “It is simply because I was in Tanga Tanga and vehemently fought to protect our deputy party leader that the state machinery was deployed to humiliate me and eventually kick me out of office,” he said. 

Official Senate records, however, show he was shown the door after being found culpable of all three counts levelled against him. The first count was violation of the Constitution, then violation of the national laws and the third count, gross misconduct. Of the 38 senators present, 28 voted him out. 

Mr Waititu, nevertheless, maintains his relationship with the President is still cordial. 

The firebrand politician clarified that he is not out to fill a vacancy left by his long-time friend, Mr Sonko, but rather contesting because the seat was declared vacant. 

“Let nobody say I am betraying my friendship with Governor Sonko by contesting. This seat was declared vacant and left open for anyone to contest. Even Sonko can still vie if he wants to,” he said. 

He, unlike Mr Sonko, has no problem with the Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS).

“Who knows, should I win, I will probably be the best person to work with the NMS. I have a lot of ideas, my PR is high and I know the issues of Nairobi very well,” he said.

“Nairobi residents know me. I am a man of the people. I am Baba Yao, they have seen my previous records and how I diligently served them.They will vote for me,” he concluded. 

He presented his papers to the registrar of political parties on Monday and later in the day presented his documents to the IEBC. He is currently awaiting the commission’s nod to contest.
