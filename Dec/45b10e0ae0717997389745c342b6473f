Trees provide unquantifiable benefits such as improving the climate, regulating stream and river flows, conserving and protecting the soil and providing stable habitats for wildlife, according to experts.Celtis africana is also an excellent shade tree because it is evergreen. For bird lovers, its fruits attract many.The wood of Celtis africana is heavy and good for making planks, shelving, yokes, tool handles, railway sleepers and furniture.Propagation of Celtis africana is mainly through seed, which costs Sh3,500 a kilo at the Kenya Forestry Research Institute centres. Celtis africana is commonly known as white stinkwood because of the unpleasant smell of its freshly cut wood and its pale colour.
It is native to Africa and grows in a wide range of habitats from the Coast up to 2,100 metres above sea level. 
Among its local names are Murudu (Kikuyu) and Toninwo (Tugen).

Trees provide unquantifiable benefits such as improving the climate, regulating stream and river flows, conserving and protecting the soil and providing stable habitats for wildlife, according to experts.
The Centre for International Forest Research (CIFOR) says tree-growing is fundamental to increasing the sustainable provision of wood, as the basis to support job creation in rural areas.
In an article titled “To pant or not to plant trees” on its online Forest News website, CIFOR says growing the right trees in the right places is one of the most cost-effective actions to enhance carbon sinks and support biodiversity.





Trees are also a source of supply of building timber, poles, plywood, wood-fuel, pulp and paper.
Other commodities and services from forests and trees include fruits, oils, tannins and medicines. 
More than one purpose
Farmers should plant trees that serve more than one purpose and Celtis africana certainly is one such a tree.
Many of its parts are used in traditional African medicine. The pounded bark is used to treat fever, headache and general malaise.
A leaf decoction is applied to sore eyes. The roots are boiled and the infusion drunk to stop shaking, according to Field Guide to the Moist Forest Trees of Tanzania by Lovett J.C.; Ruffo C.K.; Gereau R.E. and Taplin J.R.D.

The fibrous bark is often used for making ropes and cloth, according to Plant Resources of Tropical Africa.
Celtis africana is also an excellent shade tree because it is evergreen. For bird lovers, its fruits attract many.
The birds feed on the fruits and leaves and play a key role in dispersing the seeds. Its leaves are also fodder for cattle and goats.
The flowers, that appear in August to October, are pollinated by bees hence it is good for honey production, according to Trees of Southern Africa by Palmer, E. and Pitman, N. 
The wood of Celtis africana is heavy and good for making planks, shelving, yokes, tool handles, railway sleepers and furniture.
Africans have always used it to make agricultural implements and household articles like pestles, spoons, boxes and crates. 
Fairly drought-resistant
In construction, it is used for flooring, joinery, interior trim, mine props and ladders.
The wood also produces quality charcoal and firewood.
Some African communities believe the tree has magical properties and plant it in homesteads to keep evil spirits away.
Propagation
Propagation of Celtis africana is mainly through seed, which costs Sh3,500 a kilo at the Kenya Forestry Research Institute centres.

Fresh seeds germinate within 60 days. Pre-sowing treatment is not necessary, but germination is hastened by soaking seeds in cold water for 24 hours. They can be stored for some time in airtight containers.

}



The seedbeds should be filled with a mixture of parts of river sand and well-decomposed compost. To promote germination, seeds should be covered with a thin layer of river sand and kept moist. Under these circumstances, germination takes 15-30 days. The germination rate is up to 70 per cent.
Experts do not recommend the use of seeds collected from the ground because they are usually infested by insects, so it is best to harvest from the tree.
Celtis africana is fast-growing and fairly drought-resistant. Planted in good, rich soil and adequately watered, it can grow for up two metres a year.
