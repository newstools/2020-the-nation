Senate Leader of Majority Samuel Poghisio ditched the committee option and play to the gallery.One Senator told the Nation that the governor could have shot himself in the foot by opting for the plenary. A sudden about-turn by pro-Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko senators put paid efforts to have an 11-member Senate committee handle the governor’s case. 

The rapid change of plans caught Leader of the Majority in the Senate Samuel Poghisio flat-footed as the pro-Sonko senators had already begun high-level mobilisation to shoot down the committee motion by Mr Poghisio.

Not wanting to create a contest at the Senate so early in the process, the West Pokot Senator opted against moving the motion, thereby abandoning the committee route. 

According to senators who spoke to the Nation, the plenary option had started gaining momentum in the House with senators in support of the embattled Nairobi governor mobilising other like-minded members. 

This forced Mr Poghisio to ditch the committee option and play to the gallery and avoid engaging in a contest that could create a bad momentum in the House.

“The plenary option had started gaining momentum with senators in Mr Sonko’s corner drumming up support for the option with the mood of the House for plenary option,” a source said. 

“Not wanting to create a contest and start on a wrong footing, Senator Poghisio opted against going ahead with the committee, letting it go the plenary way because he did not want to create a bad momentum,” added the source. 

The 11-member committee included Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei, Kirinyaga Senator Charles Kibiru, Marsabit Senator Hargura Godana, Senator Abdullahi Ali of Wajir, nominated Senators Alice Milgo and Christine Zawadi on the Jubilee Party side. 

From the opposition side were Nyamira Senator Okong’o Omogeni, Senator Mohammed Faki from Mombasa, Kisumu Senator Fred Outa and nominated Senators Judith Pareno and Petronilla Were of ANC.

The senator, however, said the move could prove a double-edged sword as it could play into the hands of the government operatives who want Governor Sonko out of office. 

Deep pockets 

He pointed out that the governor could have been misled by cronies who also wanted to “benefit from his deep pockets” to change his mind at the last minute for their selfish interests, deceiving him that the committee option would spell his end. 

“The committee would have given him the best chance at survival as the House would still have voted on the committee’s report should they have said he goes home,” said the senator. 

“His people have misled him to opt for the plenary, not to save him but for their interest, saying the committee route would have restricted those to be ‘seen’ by the governor. So, what has happened today, which his people think is a victory, could prove to be a big loss,” the source added. 

Another senator concurred that the governor could have shot himself in the foot by opting for the plenary as he would need at least 24 members to either vote or stay away as opposed to only six in the committee. 

He said that the committee route offered him the best position to strategise as he would need to convince only the majority members of the committee to vote in his favour, adding that normally, people who want to be saved are taken through the committee as it is easier to deal with the 11 members.

“I believe he (Sonko) was misled by his cronies. He already had four members of the committee in his corner but he is now starting afresh having to marshal at least 24 members. This is not going to be easy as the government position is that he has to go,” said the senator. The Senate Business Committee (SBC) had on Tuesday proposed the formation of the special committee.
