Eyewitnesses at the scene told the Nation that the vehicle was being driven at high speed.
"The car was moving at a high speed. I saw it heading towards Mombasa Island and all of a sudden I saw it in the ocean. I rushed to rescue the occupants," said Mr Omar Chigamba, a local who saved the woman. 
He said the child managed to swim out of the vehicle and rescue himself while the mother was strapped to her seat by a safety belt.
