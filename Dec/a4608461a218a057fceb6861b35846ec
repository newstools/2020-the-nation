The likes of Mike Sonko rose to popularity due to their sharp tongues and antics that drew national attention to them.But we keep on electing warmongers and then express shock when, every day, there is a battle to be fought. This week, Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa and ODM secretary-general Edwin Sifuna exchanged unprintable insults during the Msambweni by-election campaigns.
The duo joins the ever-growing list of politicians who have decided to settle their differences in foul language. The likes of Mike Sonko rose to popularity due to their sharp tongues and antics that drew national attention to them.

In a nation where hate speech and insults have been used to incite communities against each other, one would think that every Kenyan would be on the lookout to not repeat the mistake.
And, given that these leaders insult each other in public and go and drink tea, laugh and shake hands in private, it is time the citizens of this country stopped rewarding this bad behaviour. Someone who insults another's mother should not be trusted with public service.





This behaviour also shows where our leaders’ priorities are. Campaigns are expected to be used to sell party or individual manifestos to the people. But when politicians use the opportunity to settle scores, they make it clear that serving us, their employers isn't even a priority to them.
Insulting each other
The Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) promises a brand-new Kenya full of ethics. But the people campaigning for it are the same ones insulting each other.
Meanwhile, in our estates and villages, we seek to settle our quarrels as amicably as possible, even going as far as to involve the chief. This shows that the problem isn't with us citizens, it is that the worst bunch of us somehow made it to leadership.
But we keep on electing warmongers and then express shock when, every day, there is a battle to be fought. It is time we borrowed one unethical value from our leaders — selfishness — and ensured that every leader we choose dances to whatever tune we want, not to some leader or party.

Citizens' interests should be a priority.
