A Kenyan is finally back at the helm of East African Breweries Limited (EABL) after the brewer promoted Ms Jane Karuku, an insider, to be the new Group managing director.
Ms Karuku, who has been a member of the EABL board and is the current MD of subsidiary Kenya Breweries Limited (KBL), replaces Andrew Cowan, an expatriate who has been the boss for four and a half years.

The brewer said Mr Cowan is taking up a new role in Diageo’s global business as managing director for Africa Regional Markets.
"Mrs Karuku is a dynamic business leader, with strong management experience spanning over 25 years in fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and non-governmental organisations. A consummate leader, her expansive experience straddles strategy development, operational management, marketing as well as organisational change management," the firm said in a statement.

});
}, 62000);

EABL has for years relied on expatriates to run its corner office since Gerald Mahinda left the helm in 2009, and the appointment of Ms Karuku is a big win for the KBL boss who has played second fiddle for a long time. 
Career
Before joining KBL, she was the President of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), where she was responsible for one of Africa's largest grant-making organisations in the food security and agricultural development sector.

Before Cadbury’s, Ms Karuku worked with Farmer’s Choice Kenya and Kenya Co-operative Creameries (now New KCC).

The appointments of Ms Karuku and Mr Cowan will take effect from January 1, 2021 and Mr Musunga’s appointment is effective March  1, 2021. 
Mr Cowan will remain a member of the EABL board.
“Jane brings with her remarkable wealth of experience having served within the board and also managing the Kenya business. I am very confident that her depth of expertise and knowledge of the business will lead the Group to future growth in line with our strategy," EABL Group board chairman, Dr Martin Oduor-Otieno, said.  Ms Spencer will officially leave the company on December 31, 2020 after four years at the helm.
