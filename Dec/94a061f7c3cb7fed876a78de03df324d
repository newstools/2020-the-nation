Domino’s Pizza Kenya has launched a new delicious flavour dubbed the "Sweet BBQ Mega Meat Pizza". Just as the name implies, the pizza is loaded with savoury beef, chicken, and pepperoni toppings, crowned with sweet and barbeque sauce for the ultimate treat to your taste buds.
You can order the jumbo size of the pizza, which would be ideal for a group of six, at only Ksh1,400, from www.dominos.co.ke. Or call any Domino’s store to order.
