Public health facilities in Tharaka-Nithi County are now operational after the Labour Court ordered striking health workers to resume work until a case filed by the county government is heard and determined.
A spot check at Chuka County Referral Hospital on Thursday established that patients were being served at the outpatient unit and some had already been admitted.

Services in all the 104 public health facilities in the county were paralysed from Monday to Wednesday with inpatients being moved to private hospitals.
Speaking to the Nation on Thursday, Tharaka Nithi County Health Executive Gichuyia Nthuraku assured the residents that they will continue getting health services as usual.
“Our people can now go to any of our 104 health facilities and they will be served as before,” said Dr Nthuraku.





The county has four level-four hospitals, 15 health centres and 85 dispensaries distributed across the region.
Governor Muthomi Njuki on Tuesday said his government decided to move to court to suspend the strike because he has done enough for his health workers.
He said demands such as increment of risk allowance, compensation of those who succumb to Covid-19 disease, and formation of a health service commission can only be implemented by the national government.
Governor Njuki noted that he had cleared salary arrears amounting to Sh233 million that had accumulated since 2016, promoted those who deserved and employed on permanent and pensionable terms those hired on contract by the previous administration.
He warned that those who will not resume duty will lose their monthly salary and, in case they stay away for the whole month, they will be replaced.

“There are many health workers who are outside there and willing to work as county government employers,” said Governor Njuki.
The case will be mentioned today in Meru for further directions.
