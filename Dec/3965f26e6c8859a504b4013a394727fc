Whereas there are no official statistics on the number of current and deceased professors in the area, a rough count seems to give credence to the contemporary legend.
Being regarded as one of the first areas in the country to embrace formal education, Gem residents attribute the development to the efforts made by colonial chief Odera Akang’o who forcibly enrolled children to compulsory primary education from 1915.
Considered as a benevolent dictator, Akang’o used his own police officers to arrest and cane parents whose children were not going to school.





“He laid the path on which the residents transitioned to higher learning at a time when other parts of the country were either grappling with colonial-instigated violence or preoccupied with means of toppling colonialists,” said renowned historian Prof Bethwel Ogot in a past interview.
Prof Ogot, also a native of Gem Sub County, has also managed to educate his son, Prof Madara Ogot - a don at the University of Nairobi.
Akang’o who was invited to Uganda for the consecration of the Namirembe Cathedral was impressed with how the British education had improved the mannerism of young school-going children and were able to read and write.
His great grandson Mr George Nyamwanga while noting that the colonial chief played an instrumental role in the establishment of St Mary’s School, Yala pointed out that most professors hail from his Kagola clan.
