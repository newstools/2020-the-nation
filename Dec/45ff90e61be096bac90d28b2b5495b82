The two collapsed in the cells and died at Kimbimbi Sub-County Hospital.Police later said the two could have succumbed to Covid-19 complications. Investigations into the death of two remandees who collapsed at Wang'uru police station and later died in hospital have begun.
The probe kicks off following a post-mortem report that showed that Martin Musyoka, 58, and John Njeru, 28, may have succumbed to injuries inflicted at the station or lack of sufficient oxygen occasioned by congestion.

According to Mwea East Sub-County police boss Daniel Kitavi, an inquest file has been opened by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI).
"The DCI is now investigating the matter and we urge relatives of the two remand prisoners to be patient. We would like to establish who caused the death of the duo," he said.
Mr Kitavi said remandees and convicts who had been locked up in the same cell with the victims have been questioned and recorded statements.

The two were arrested on November 20, 2020Â during a major crackdown on people who were flouting curfew rules imposed by the government to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
The two villagers were seized in Mikimaini and Thiba villages in Mwea East Sub-County and locked up at the police station.
However, the following day, they collapsed in the cells as they waited to be taken to court and were rushed to Kimbimbi Sub-County Hospital where they died.
Police later said the two could have succumbed to Covid-19 complications.
The county police commander Leah Kithei told the media that the remand prisoners fell sick when they were at the station and were taken to hospital.
She dismissed claims by relatives that they had been assaulted while in the cells.

She also denied claims that the duo was in crowded cells and might, therefore, have suffocated to death.
Post-mortem report 
However, a post-mortem report revealed that the suspects may have died of injuries inflicted at the police station or lack of sufficient oxygen due to congestion.
Government Chief Pathologist Dr Johansen Oduor disapproved of the theory by the police that Covid-19 claimed the lives of the victims.
According to Dr Oduor, who performed the autopsy at Kerugoya Referral Hospital mortuary, both victims had internal head and stomach injuries and lacked enough oxygen.
Following the post-mortem, families of the two villagers are now crying for justice.
Meanwhile, Kiambaa MP Paul Koinange, who is also the National Assembly Committee on Administration and Security chairman, has vowed to raise the matter with Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiang'i.
The committee chairman expressed concern over the deplorable state of Wang'uru police station in Kirinyaga County where the two remandees were locked up before their death.
He described the police station as unsafe and dangerous for both officers and remandees.
Mr Koinange sad the station, which was built in 1957 during the colonial era, was congested and needed to be expanded.

});
}, 62000);
}



"This is a very old police station. It cannot serve the remand prisoners well. The station lacks adequate facilities like toilets while the cells are congested. Something urgent should be done to make the remand prisoners safe," Mr Koinange said.





The committee was shocked to find filthy and stinking toilets when it visited the station on Wednesday afternoon.
"The toilets, which have no doors for privacy, are overflowing with human waste. The situation is really bad," said Mr Koinange. It all started on November 20 when the two villagers were arrested and locked up for flouting curfew rules.
