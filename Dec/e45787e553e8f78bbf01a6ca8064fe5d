Despite the report being sent out while the militants continued with their lecture, no security apparatus responded to the incident.
The Deputy County Commissioner Khorof Harar, Mr Ibrahim Muchangi, said the incident was reported on Friday evening and that investigations are underway.
Terror incidents
"We had a report made from that area but we are in process of finding out what exactly happened since the area is experiencing clan feuds and we just don’t want to conclude that it is about Al-Shabaab,” Muchangi said by phone.
The administrator said due to the poor communication network, it remains unclear if the chief is within the area or is indeed missing.
Mr Muchangi, however declined to comment on the reported lecture by militants, only stating that investigations are underway.
Khorof Harar was in August elevated to a sub county with the national government pledging to beef up security in an area that lies along the porous Somalia border.
