This is after the Zone Five Championships which were set for January to select the teams for the final tour was shelved. 
"KPA and Equity Bank women have been regular participants at our past events and were the only teams that had confirmed their participation for the Zone Five Championships that Tanzania had bid to host, thus our decision to pick the two for the event that has attracted among others clubs from  top African basketball playing countries Senegal, Angola, Mozambique, and Nigeria," Bile said in his letter.





KBF assistant secretary Ambrose Kisoi Wednesday said he has been in communication with Fiba on the same and has already sent letters to the respective teams for action.   
"I'm happy Kenyan teams have been picked directly for the final tour ahead of clubs from other countries in our zone like Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Burundi and South Sudan. This is a clear pointer that Fiba have confidence in our structures which is good for the country," said Kisoi who is likely to take over from long-serving KBF Secretary General Vitalis Gode at the KBF elections set for January 23. 
According to Kisoi, KPA management has already confirmed their women's team will be in Cairo for the event and is now awaiting Equity Bank's confirmation ahead of the January 15 deadline set by Fiba.

KPA women qualified for the African Championships last year but failed to participate due to some technicalities among them lack of funds at that time. 
KPA women's team manager Christopher Magic Ogutu Wednesday said the teams technical bench will soon meet and strategise for the championships. 
"We have recruited very young and talented players as per KPA policy who if combined with the experienced players like captain Hilda Indasi, Vilma Awino, Seline Okumu, Becky Nkatha and Natalie Mwangale among others should give other African countries a run for their money," said Ogutu. 
Apart from Kaya Tiwi Secondary School girls Barbra Diana Aranda, Vidah Adhiambo and Medina Okot Mullah, KPA recruited polished players among them Terry Ekise and Diana Apiyo from Kenyatta University, Caroline Akinyi from Lady Bucks Kisumu, Catherine Oloo from Western Delight and Celia Okumu from Tangit Sparks.
Others are Mary Lisa Omondi formerly of Butere Girls, Yvonne Atieno formerly of Kaya Tiwi, Halima Nzomo and Vivian Nafula from KPA youth.  The journalists were covering an earlier incident where Bobi Wine and his bodyguard were arrested by police. Before his disappearance and death, Kipyegon Kenei was to record a statement at the DCI headquarters. Education CS says the government has done everything possible to facilitate the resumption of learning in schools.
