During his tenure as Chief Justice, Maraga has had frequent brushes with the Executive.Outgoing CJ asked not to shut the door to locals who will be visiting him for greetings and help. Away from the trappings of his official office, the outgoing Chief Justice and President of the Supreme Court of Kenya, Mr David Kenani Maraga, is revered as an elder in his local church and community.
The Gusii community looks for guidance from the man who rose to the lofty position of a top judge despite his humble beginning as an advocate of the High Court in Nakuru town.

During his tenure as Chief Justice, Maraga has had frequent brushes with the Executive, mostly due to his strict stance in line with his calling as a protector of the law. 
However, Judge Maraga is also a church elder, one who mingles freely with the common folk.
Lately, in his rural county of Nyamira, he has been socialising more and more with elders from the community, perhaps a psychological preparation of life after retirement. 





He has been using his official tours of Nyamira County to rally the Abagusii community to uphold hard work, good morals, honesty and integrity.
While re-launching the Manga Law Courts on Monday, the CJ disclosed that as an SDA church elder, he will use much of his time after retirement to do church work.
“I am here today with my friend and elder, retired Judge Samuel Bosire with whom we do some work in Maxwell SDA Church in Nairobi,” he said.
While addressing the gathering, Mr Bosire specifically directed his message to Maraga, appearing to prepare him for what awaits him in retirement.
“You are used to a very busy schedule, but all this will end abruptly and you will feel like you are in a different world all together. You see, you will be waking up and you have nowhere to go. Functions you attend will be very few and you will need to decide what to do with the many suits you have, because once you retire, you will barely need them. For example, I only put them on when going to church and the few functions I am called to attend,” said Mr Bosire.

});

Further, he asked the CJ not to shut the door to locals who will be visiting him for greetings and help.
Retirement home
“It will be a lonely life for you on one hand, because right now you’re used to the hustle and bustle of the big city, Nairobi, and the busy Judiciary. Once you retire, the setting will be different and you will mostly be at your home and your visitors will mainly be locals. They will come, many of them, mostly seeking help of whatever nature. Please let your door remain open for them,” counselled Mr Bosire.
In response, the CJ said that due to his status, he ensured he had many suits.
“But I will decide what to do with them once I have retired,” he said.
Though his retirement home is in Nakuru, he is fond of his rural county. Bosose, his village of birth, is the first beneficiary of his eldership.
In a move aimed at giving back to the society, CJ Maraga funded the construction of various projects at a primary school in his rural home in Bosose village, Nyamira County.

});
}, 62000);
}



The projects at Bosesa primary school, whose construction started in March this year, and were commissioned Tuesday by the CJ, are the administration block, a kitchen and a fence.
The projects are expected to go a long way in giving learners a conducive learning environment.

});
}, 62000);
}



Speaking during the commissioning ceremony, Mr Maraga said he will sponsor two top candidates from the school up to university level.
"During our times we used to go to school barefoot, something that motivates me to assist the less privileged in society," he said.
He added that depending on the availability of funds, he will spearhead the construction of a library in the school.
Early this year, the outgoing CJ contributed on the construction of a building at Lutheran church in the region. 
According to the school's head teacher, Ms Daureen Mashine, the institution has a total population of 360 learners with 27 of them in a special unit. Through his friends, the CJ, who is also the patron of the school, donated computers and furniture.   Apart from the virtual courts, the Judiciary recently introduced the electronic filing system.
