The coronavirus disease was first detected in Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019 and first confirmed in Kenya on March 13.
By December 13, 967 of Kenya's patients had been admitted to hospitals countrywide while 6,583 were under home-based isolation and care. 
CS Kagwe said 48 of them were in intensive care units, 28 on ventilator support, 18 on supplemental oxygen and two under observation.
Another 48 patients were separately on supplemental oxygen but in general wards (39) and high dependency units (nine).  NHIF says it has not received the Sh6.3 billion for medical cover despite Kagwe announcing so days ago.
