Increased cases of diseases with no available cure are ravaging rural communities. These include HIV-Aids, cancer and now there is the fear of the coronavirus pandemic. In Homa Bay County, Ikri Kendi is a welfare group that has gained popularity among rural communities. 

In Dholuo, Ikri Kendi literally means ‘bury yourself’. But what has driven villagers to come up with this bizarre idea that appears to focus on death rather than life? 

For one, increased cases of diseases with no available cure are ravaging rural communities. These include HIV-Aids, cancer and now there is the fear of the coronavirus pandemic.

So villagers in parts of Homa Bay have left these matters to divine intervention.  

Hopelessness has driven some villagers to ensure that should they be felled by these diseases, they can find solace in contributing money to plan for their burials, well in advance, just in case.  

This led to the formation of groups such as the Orinde Welfare Association (OWA), which is found in Kojwach Ward, that have attracted the membership of locals in large numbers.

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}




According to the chairperson Michael Arara, OWA was formed in 1978 but had a small number of members at  inception.  

However, OWA has gained momentum decades later with its membership now standing at slightly over 2,000. The association is yet to be registered formally with the government's department of Social Services.  

"We are simply operating like a big clan. We have no intention of registering,” Mr Arara explains.  

"We are in a mission to financially cushion bereaved families and ensure a decent send-off for our members. Funerals are expensive and so we are ensuring families do not sell everything to foot bills during times of sorrow," said Mr Arara.  

Mortuary bills 

OWA's membership includes both the unemployed rural folk and individuals with a salary, especially teachers.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}




It also has some doctors and engineers. Mr Arara told the Nation that some of their members work abroad and promptly send in their contributions. They are required to contribute Sh50 per month.  

Notably, the majority of OWA members do not have any form of health insurance scheme, not even the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) where one can remit a minimum of Sh500 per month.  

Asked whether OWA has a plan to ensure members have a health insurance plan, as this would reduce deaths of those suffering from treatable illnesses, Mr Arara said: 

"That is not why OWA came into being. But if members were to make such proposals then we can consider. Whatever we subscribe per funeral is less than a dollar but insurance would demand more. That will make OWA expensive for our poor people." 

The death of a member or any child from five years attracts Sh50 per head. This would mean that with all members contributing, OWA has the potential to raise Sh100,000 per funeral. 

The amount is enough to take care of mortuary bills, hearse, tents and chairs, as well as catering for the usual razzmatazz that often characterises funerals in the Luo community. 

OWA has no bank account because funds are contributed during burials and the whole amount committed to that particular funeral. The amount is also spent on meals to entertain mourners.

});
}, 62000);
}




Members also contribute half a kilogramme of maize grain. Currently, OWA has purchased tents and no longer needs to hire during funerals. This has helped the group save on costs. 

If a couple are both members of OWA, each one of them gets to contribute independently. 

Just like a person may have a robust health cover but does not fall sick to ''enjoy'' his or her health insurance, OWA has members who have been contributing for so long but have not died or lost a loved one to use their ''death investment''. 

But no one is giving up. The group’s membership has been growing. In fact, according to the chairperson, today, OWA members have crossed the borders of Kabondo Kasipul Constituency into the neighbouring Kanyango clan of Kasipul Constituency. 

Apart from OWA, there is another group known as ''Bury Yourself'' or Kojwach Moyie. 

Less expensive  

The group is based in the same ward (Kojwach in Kabondo Kasipul constituency). It has members in their thousands and is chaired by Mr Paul Aroko. 

According to Kojwach East Chief James Oindi, the 'Ikri Kendi' organisations in his area have achieved their mission. 

"Funerals have become less expensive. The only thing that your organisation needs to start thinking about is how to enrol members into a health insurance scheme (NHIF). The majority are poor and end up dying of treatable illness due to lack of money to foot hospital bills,” said the administrator.

Mr Oindi gave the following advice to members of the welfare groups during a meeting in Orinde Village: "I know it will be expensive for members but it will make a lot of sense to treat than to wait for death. It makes sense to preserve than bury life. 

"Our association has saved a lot of families from funeral-related squabbles with clanmembers because of lack of finances," said Mr Arara. 

A member of Kojwach Moyie said in an interview: "In this country, we are on our own. Even if we were to religiously pay for NHIF, there are diseases not covered and I will end up dying. Take for example Covid-19 and cancer, these diseases are everywhere and nobody is properly covered.

});
}, 62000);
}




"The amount we are contributing is very little but it means a lot when every member contributes. We pay less during death than is expected for NHIF. When I die, I want to give my family easy time. I don't want to bother people. Many members aim at burying themselves," she said. The child's decomposing body was discovered without the head, hands and legs.
