The call centre, with a capacity of receiving 100 calls simultaneously.It is expected to play a complementary role in preventing, disrupting and deterring serious crimes. A toll-free crime reporting hotline – 0800722203 -- has been launched for use by Kenyans anonymously.
Speaking during its launch, Mr George Kinoti, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss, said the line is housed at a modern call centre within the directorate’s offices, in partnership with the UK Government’s National Crime Agency (NCA).

}



The call centre will be manned at all hours by specially vetted DCI officers from different fields, who are trained in customer relations and who can speak several languages, including Somali, French, German, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese and Italian.
Mr Kinoti, who was accompanied by Mr James Duddridge, the minister for Africa at the UK’s Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office, UK Ambassador to Kenya Jane Mariot and Mr John Gachomo, the head of the Anti-Terror Police Unit, said all the information received will be analysed and acted upon in real time.

});
}, 62000);
}



“The information given will form a prima facie ground upon which appropriate operations will be planned and executed after the information has been analysed by the appropriate units,” said Mr Kinoti.
The call centre, with a capacity of receiving 100 calls simultaneously, went live on Thursday and is expected to play a complementary role in preventing, disrupting and deterring serious crimes in the country and beyond the borders.
It will also assist the directorate in forming a sustainable intelligence database that will help in formulation of strategies that help manage crime.
Informer's identity
“The identity of the caller is completely encrypted so as to shield, insulate and protect the identity of the informer,” said Mr Kinoti.

The public is encouraged to give information, particularly on some of the most concealed crimes such as gender-based violence, female genital mutilation, child marriages, sexual exploitation of children, sexual assault, sexual abuse, child cyber bullying, online stalking, children servitude, among many others.
Mr Kinoti noted that such crimes are concealed due to intimidation, compromise, fear, shame, blackmail, stigmatisation and rejection, amongst other factors mitigating against the victims.Mr Duddridge said similar hotlines established in the UK and elsewhere have been successful.
“I look forward to seeing the results from this important work and continuing the excellent cooperation between the UK and Kenya in tackling serious and organised crime … It is important to note that the DCI will not try to trace your call and you can call this number in full confidence,” he said.
Other crimes that Kenyans have been encouraged to report are human trafficking, including theft of children, and conspiracy to steal children mostly in hospitals and at children’s homes, illegal adoptions, drug trafficking and abuse, terrorism, terrorism financing, known sleeper cells, known terrorist sympathisers, money laundering, crimes against the public such as corruption, bribery and any other transnational-organised crime.
