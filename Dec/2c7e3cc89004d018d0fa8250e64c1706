Kennedy Chesoli: Kenyans opposed to the intolerance, fraud perpetuated through the BBI

Winds of change, signalling a political reawakening, are blowing across the land and Ukambani is the epicentre for this phenomenon. In the past few months, Charity Ngilu and Kalonzo Musyoka — individuals that seek to dominate Ukambani politics — have been publicly humiliated.

Irked by the presence of Moses Kuria at a Building Bridges Initiative rally in Kitui last February, Ngilu took to the microphone and ordered immediate ejection of the Member of Parliament for Gatundu South. Ngilu was simply setting the stage for the agenda of the day — insolent attacks on the Deputy President and his allies — something that had become the mainstay of those Raila Odinga-led rallies.
Instead of a thunderous roar of approval, Ngilu was booed and heckled. The Kitui governor had gone too far and her own people were there to remind her that she was misusing her power and office.





 They demanded that Kuria gets seated among the day’s dignitaries where he truly belonged. This singular act of defiance and civil disobedience would come to define that infamous rally. Madam Ngilu is a brilliant politician, yet BBI seems to have clouded her judgment and she is not alone.
Corrupt officials
Nearly all politicians that have pledged blind support to President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga to amend the Constitution, whichever way they see fit, regard themselves as new owners of the Republic. They are untouchable; for one of them even shot someone in a club, on camera, and continued to puff on his cigar.

Governors can pillage public resources with utter impunity but remain secure in their position. Yes, we have been dazed by the magic of muosho mmoja on Capitol Hill. The point here is that supporting the BBI offers corrupt officials complete immunity from persecution by the current administration. It was for this reason that Ngilu saw no fault in inciting the public against Kuria et al — for Kitui had become a slice of Kenya that she co-owned with the so-called Deep State.
Mr Musyoka is a former Vice-President and a man of distinguished career in politics and public service. He understands the importance of protocol in the functioning of the society.
Despite knowing that the Deputy President and the Principal Assistant to the President would attend the burial of Machakos Senator, Mutinda Kabaka, State House tasked Mr Musyoka with the responsibility of reading the President’s statement.
Public humiliation
This was yet another act of political foolery, which continues to dominate the post-handshake Kenya. Mr Musyoka is wrong in thinking the “system” could accept and embrace him if he contributes to the never-ending efforts to undermine the Office of the Deputy President and the public humiliation of the office holder. Rejecting this kind of madharau, mourners opted to walk out on the Kamba kingpin.

Despite repeated pleas for audience, Mr Musyoka embarrassingly read hollow platitudes to empty chairs. These events exemplify ways in which Kenyans are expressing disgust to the stream of nonsense, intolerance, and fraud perpetuated through the BBI. It’s instructive that people are finally taking a stand against these chest-thumping fellas with inflated egos. They are making it clear that they would no longer accept to be corralled and steered like passive sheep to the slaughterhouse.





Unwarranted scorn
The President seems to relish public humiliation of his deputy and has not reprimanded members of his government, including his Cabinet secretaries that continue to undermine the office of the Deputy President.
At one of the BBI events, the man was visibly delighted and giddy as the likes of Junet Mohamed mocked and humiliated the DP. Whereas the DP has remained largely unmoved, he continues to attract unwarranted scorn from a long list of individuals, including the Secretary-General of Cotu Francis Atwoli, Mombasa Governor Hassan Ali Joho and the Chairman of the Kenya Human Rights Commission.
BBI proponents may mock the DP or force Kenyans to swallow their bitter pill, but that would still not make it right or palpable. Ms Ngilu and Mr Musyoka must explain to the residents of Lower Eastern how expanding the Executive and jerking up taxes would transform lives.

In Western Kenya, Musalia Mudavadi and other supremos should not merely get Luhyas to endorse a document that has no real benefits to them. They should first explain why they have allowed this government to undermine the sugar sector which supported their community. This is people-centric discussion that is more important than ever, given Covid-inspired challenges.
