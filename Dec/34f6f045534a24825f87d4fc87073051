Quarrel 
A neighbour, Joseph Maina, told the Nation that he heard the two quarrel on Thursday morning, but did not know what transpired later.
The suspect confessed to police that he fatally stabbed the woman in the stomach following a disagreement.
"They had a quarrel early in the morning of the new year’s eve, but I did not hear any commotion from the house," said Mr Maina.
The police chief said the suspect will be charged in court on Monday after undergoing a psychiatric test at the Gilgil Hospital.
The body was taken to Egerton University mortuary. The year 2020 will go into the annals of history as one riddled with high-profile financial scandals. On Monday, the Makadara Law Courts in Nairobi were full of suspects who were arrested between December 24 and 27. In his new year’s message to the country, the President called for a renewal of minds in the New Year 2021. He paraded the newly elected Msambweni MP Feisal Bader as the “firstborn” of the so called Hustler's Movement. Ever since Abiy Ahmed came to power, the Tigray regional government has been at odds with the central government.
