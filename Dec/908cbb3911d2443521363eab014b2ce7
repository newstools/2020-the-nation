From the point of international trade, the virus cost the world economy about US$2.5 trillion.In politics, it was the year of ‘Trump Trouble’ for democracy.  It goes without saying that 2020 is the worst year for most of us. Annus horribilis, a terrible year.
A lot of tragedies keep us staring at screens, newspapers and radios. With the Covid-19 pandemic, economic collapse, unemployment, heavy debt and a surge in insecurity, many Kenyans will be happy to see the end of 2020.

Also, Kenya was elected a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, defeating Djibouti for a seat designated for African countries in June, a good thing for the nation. After all, it was not many years in history that a pandemic sparked terror worldwide. 
Big or small, poor or wealthy, white, black or brown, the pandemic doesn’t discriminate. The truth is that the virus seems to have deliberately shown its more horrible form to developed and powerful countries.
The United States, India, Brazil, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy have excellent economies and health infrastructure but suffered heavily. 





International trade
More than 80 million people in the world have been infected. From the point of international trade, the virus cost the world economy about US$2.5 trillion.
As in the 1990s, it has been argued many times in favour of globalisation that it will bring the world closer in the face of a deep global crisis.
Different countries will give up small personal interests, and the whole world will stand together against the pandemic. But with Covid-19, we saw all countries close their borders to the rest of the world.
In politics, it was the year of ‘Trump Trouble’ for democracy. In the US presidential election, Trump’s defeat was not an explosion, as it seemed to be written on the wall several months ago.

However, the explosion was Trump’s nonsense, which kept coming up all year. The DP's ambition to take over from his boss after the 2022 elections is a road with two paths. The decision is a blow to two aspirants who had applied to the party for sponsorship to contest the seat. This shift of focus is so dire that the World Health Organization now warns that by the end of 2020, more people will have died of malaria than Covid-19.
