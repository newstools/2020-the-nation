The stage is set for a political showdown in Deputy President William Ruto’s political bastion of Rift Valley, between proponents and opponents of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).
Those pushing for the BBI process, expected to culminate in a referendum in June, are led by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi and Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos.

They have accused DP Ruto and his allies of misleading the Kalenjin community.
Speaking in Iten on Saturday, during a BBI consultative forum, Mr Moi, who is also Kanu party’s chairman, said it is now time for the electorate to decide their future.
“All those opposing this document are after ill-motives. It is not a completely perfect document but it is the best for [addressing] the woes ailing this country. Only the Bible and the Quran are perfect,” he said.

He challenged the youth to support the initiative for the benefits it accords them.
“If 30 per cent of the resources to the counties will be for the youth and there will be a tax holiday why join the naysayers?”
Political gains
Mr Tolgos, a key player in the BBI process in the region, said opponents are unrealistic and have taken the position to please their masters or gain political mileage.
The governor said the BBI is the best thing to ever happen to counties like Elgeyo Marakwet which have been complaining of underfunding.
He reiterated that the opponents should have raised their concerns at the initial stages instead of talking ill of the BBI “when it is about to be passed”.
“How can a leader from a county like Elgeyo Marakwet go against a proposal that will add Sh3 million to the annual revenue allocation to the county? That is the highest level of self-centeredness and insensitivity to the needs of the people,” said the governor.

“If [those] pushing for more resources to the grassroots are considered enemies of the community, so be it.”
Moiben MP Silas Tiren said those opposing the BBI are enemies of the community as it carries beneficial reforms.
“Some individuals used to discourage our people from supporting this document but have now come together and pushed the agenda of moving the country forward. Let us put politics aside,” he said.
“There are several good things in this document. Take your time to read the report. It is going to change lives.”
The legislator further said the report outlines measures for dealingl with corruption.
“The document talks about how to deal with corruption. Perhaps this is why they are against it. If the BBI is passed, you cannot hold any public office if you are corrupt and your graft case will be concluded within six months.”
Opponents’ issues
During the BBI signature collection exercise which was concluded on Friday, the DP’s allies from the region asked residents not sign until they are explicitly told what the report is about.
They said the government should channel its resources to the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.





Woman Representative Gladys Boss Shollei accused the BBI Secretariat of coming up with an unconstitutional “bait” to lure Kenyans into a trap.

“These people have included things like an additional 70 constituencies. The BBI team has no constitutional mandate to review boundaries,” she said.
Nandi Governor Stephen Sang said that unless farmers’ affairs are factored into the BBI report, they will not support it.
The county chief also asked residents not to be part of a process which will increase the wage bill by increasing the number of legislators.
“'Unless they include issues of tea, maize, sugarcane and others in this report we have no business supporting it. Voters must not be part of the issue of increasing the number of lawmakers at they will overburden them,” he said.
Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago said the focus of those allied to the DP is not the BBI but the “big fight” in 2022 - the State House bid.
Nandi Deputy Governor Yulita Cheruiyot asked the pro-BBI team to desist from “forcing the document down our throats” until contentious issues are resolved. Rift Valley politicians have hit out at the DP, saying he is sitting on the fence on the Building Bridges Initiative. The next step is verification of the signatures by the IEBC, which the secretariat says will take two weeks. Detectives will review footage capturing events of September 21 at around 10am outside the KRA offices. A spot check by the Nation found patients lying helpless in beds with relatives preferring to transfer them to private hospitals The talks aim to reach consensus before referendum signatures are handed to IEBC.
