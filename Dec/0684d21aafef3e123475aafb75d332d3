Kenya’s captain James Gachago said that their target is to triumph in the competition.“Everyone is motivated to do the best for Kenya. The plan is to qualify for Afcon and also win the regional title. We are trying to get as far as possible and I think we will make history for Kenya. That is what motivates the players,” said Gachago, who is based in England. The Kenya Under-17 national men's football team wants to make history by qualifying for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Morocco.
The team of 25 players and their officials jetted out of the county for Rwanda on Tuesday, for this year’s Cecafa Under-17 championships that will take place from December 12 to 22.

The competition's finalists will qualify for the continental showpiece.
Kenya has been pooled in Group A alongside South Sudan, Uganda and Ethiopia, while Group B comprises hosts Rwanda, Tanzania, Sudan and Djibouti.
Umuganda Stadium in Rubavu District and Huye Stadium in Huye Districts are the venues of the 10-day event.

The squad largely features players who formed part of the Football Kenya Federation Centre of Excellence that reached the final of the Cecafa U-17 Championships last year.
The rest are players scouted from the fortnight-long national selection exercise that saw a selection panel traverse the country in search of emerging talents.
Team coach Oliver Page said they are ready for the challenge and thanked Cecafa for being firm on teams fielding players within the competition age requirement.
“I think we have chances, we can compete because we selected well from all over the country. Cecafa is keen on having the right age. We did our MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and had to release some players because the age was not right. Now I think teams known for coming with older players like Uganda and Tanzania have to adapt to the age system,” said Page.
