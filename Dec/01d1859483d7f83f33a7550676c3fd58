Top on the list is the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, the next Olympic Games in 2024 and the next All African Games in 2022 in Bamako are crucial for the once dreaded boxing team.Boxing Federation of Kenya President Anthony “Jamal” Otieno who was elected in June last year seemed to have started work on a good footing before Covid-19 disrupted local sports. It has been a tough season for boxing in Kenya with no fireworks in the ring, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole boxing calendar  could not withstand the devastating blow from the deadly virus and was knocked down.
As the “Hit Squad”, Kenya’s national boxing team, prepares to punch back after Covid-19 drawback, is clear that  2020 proved a tough boxing year for the national team.

Even before the deadly pandemic unleashed a devastating blow that disrupted global sports, all was not well at the “Hit Squad” camp.
Kenya competed in the African qualifiers for the Olympics in Dakar, Senegal, from February 20 - 28, and the verdict was that the team was not ready for the Olympic contest.
Kenya’s performance at the imposing Dakar International Expo Centre in Diamniadio was below par. It was evident the residential training camp the team attended  in Nanyuki under coach Musa Benjamin did not produce the magic spark.

Only two boxers made the cut for the Olympics. Team captain, featherweight Nick Okoth, and female boxer flyweight Christine Ongare won their slots. Shaffi Bakari (flyweight), Boniface Mogunde (welter), Humphrey Ochieng (light-heavy), Joseph Shighali (lightweight), Elly Ajowi (heavy), Fred Ramogi (super heavy) and Rayton Okwiri (middleweight) fell by the wayside.

The women squad also got a devastating blow. Those who kissed the canvas include Elizabeth Andiego (middle), Elizabeth Akinyi (welter), Everlyne Akinyi (lightweight), Beatrice Akoth (feather).
At least 37 African boxers won their bouts to qualify for the postponed Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games which will be held next year.

The fading “Hit Squad” has a final round to increase the number of qualified Kenyan boxers during the final round of Olympics qualifiers slated for June next year in Paris. Coach Benjamin is optimistic that at least three more Kenyans will qualify for the Olympics.
“There is still hope we shall have at least three more boxers qualify for the next Olympic Games,” Benjamin said.

What is almost certain is that sending more boxers to Tokyo will be a tall order for the team unless boxers get international exposure ahead of the final round of qualifiers. 
The team cancelled a planned training camp planned for January in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan that would have given the boxers the much-needed exposure.
“Sharpening skills at home is not bad but there is need to gauge our skills and techniques with established boxing nations. It is sad that Boxing Federation of Kenya could not secure funds for boxers to train in Europe,” said one of the boxers.
“It wouldn’t make sense for us to go for a local residential training camp and still expect good results in the qualifiers,” said a female pugilist.
In 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro,  Rayton Okwiri (welterweight), Peter Mungai (flyweight) and Benson Gicharu (bantamweight) represented Kenya. All of them did not go past the round of 16.

While Okwiri is determined to win  an Olympics slot, policeman Gicharu has since thrown in the towel to concentrate on coaching budding pugilists in Nairobi.

Tokyo Olympics was scheduled for July 24-August 9 but was postponed due to coronavirus pandemic which halted sporting activities to a halt.
As the “Hit Squad” prepares to push for more slots in the Tokyo Games, 2021 will be full of activities as the squad prepares for three major international events.
Top on the list is the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, the next Olympic Games in 2024 and the next All African Games in 2022 in Bamako are crucial for the once dreaded boxing team.
