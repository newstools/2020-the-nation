A man's body was Friday found hacked to death and dumped in a rice farm at Kithiriti village in Kirinyaga.
Area residents who stumbled on the victim's body reported the matter to the police who visited the scene and moved the body to Kerugoya Referral Hospital mortuary for postmortem examination.
The body of the victim, whose identity is yet to be established, had serious head injuries, an indication of a probable brutal murder.

} The child's decomposing body was discovered without the head, hands and legs. It all began with rumours of a pregnancy and accusations of infidelity.
