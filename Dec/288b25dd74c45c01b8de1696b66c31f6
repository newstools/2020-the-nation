Mr Odinga has abandoned his previous stand, even “advising” health care workers to respect the oath they took.Mr Odinga and Dr Ruto are not the only ones in the doublespeak boat. Immediately seven doctors’ union officials were released by the courts for leading what would become a 100-day work boycott, Orange Democratic Movement boss Raila Odinga led the opposition in a mid-morning rally at Uhuru Park.
The date was February 26, 2017 and the rally was celebratory since the union officials had just been freed from jail. They vowed to push on with their demands.

The doctors wanted a 2013 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) implemented, saying negotiations took two years. 
The agreement gave doctors a 150 to 180 per cent basic pay rise. They also wanted a review of their working conditions, job structures and criteria for promotions. 
They had told the government to address understaffing in hospitals before going back to work.
The unionists braved a 30-day jail term for what the Employment Court said was contempt, after a judge declared the strike illegal in December 2016.





Mr Odinga was with the doctors in court and at Uhuru Park.
He promised to stand with them and vowed to take the CBA fight where it belonged – at the doorsteps of President Uhuru Kenyatta, whom he labelled “incompetent and heartless”.
“This is the time the President should speak out. Many Kenyans have died in hospital and at home while the President is busy championing voter registration,” Mr Odinga told the crowd.
“The government appended its signature on the CBA. You cannot sign an agreement with a party and then arrest the same party. Shame on you!” he said. 
Fast forward to December 7, 2020, when doctors threatened to go on strike, complaining about the same things.
Abandoned his stand

Mr Odinga abandoned his stand, even “advising” health care workers to respect the oath they took.
“All I want to do is appeal to our doctors to be understanding. We are in a crisis. People are dying.
It is not only doctors who are dying,” Mr Odinga said in Kisumu on Monday.
“This is not the time to hold the government to ransom. Doctors themselves took an oath to protect lives. How can you justify a strike when people are dying?”
Mr Odinga’s utterances have portrayed him as a government apologist, apparently softened by the March 2018 handshake with President Kenyatta.
Even more interesting, the handshake has transformed Deputy President William Ruto to an opposition leader in his own government.
“Health care workers will be properly paid. No woman will pay for maternity care and no Kenyan will travel abroad for treatment. Strikes ended with the government of (Mwai) Kibaki and the man of riddles. The workers are the backbone of the nation,” Dr Ruto said in February 2013, when Jubilee launched its manifesto.
The speech has become a major point of reference when mocking Dr Ruto in his newfound opposition role.
When the 100-day strike had just started in December 2016, he tweeted: “We urge doctors to be humane, go back to work and continue negotiations with the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. A solution will be found.”

});
}, 62000);
}








He has now “seen the light”, shouting from rooftops about the government’s misplaced priorities and accusing Mr Odinga of being insensitive to doctors for making the same plea he made in 2016.
“It is reckless and irresponsible for anybody to say we should wait for political processes to find the money to address the pandemic. That is putting the cart before the horse,” Dr Ruto said in Kericho, capitalising on the crisis to attack the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) he halfheartedly supports.
Doublespeak boat
Yet Mr Odinga and Dr Ruto are not the only ones in the doublespeak boat.
Mr Kenyatta pledged to fix the health sector in the manifesto he launched in 2017.
“We will build a healthy nation and a productive workforce because Kenyans deserve to know they can be treated when at their most vulnerable and because the economic status of a country is closely associated with the health of its people,” the President said. 
“We seek to reduce the cost of health care, which has driven families into financial ruin. We will ensure that every citizen has access to the best possible healthcare at the most affordable cost.”
The words sound hollow today, with operations at most public hospitals disrupted by strikes.Patients are either being moved to private hospitals or home.

When the 100-day strike ended in 2017, the President admonished doctors.
“We will pay you, but we know you will not return the lives lost during the strike,” he said. He has maintained a loud silence as doctors complain of dying at work and being exposed to a deadly virus.
At Afya House, the building that Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe admits “has its fair share of cartels”, the minister and his juniors cannot put their house in order.
They have a schedule to release Sh5.9 billion protective equipment at the government drugs agency. 
The protective gear have been lying idle at the warehouse as doctors catch the virus in hospital while tending to patients.
While Mr Kagwe told Senators on November 11 that he had written to Kemsa to release the PPE and masks, Kemsa CEO Edward Njoroge told the House on Monday that the agency never received such instructions.

Additional reporting by Samwel Owino DP Ruto says it is irresponsible of Mr Odinga to seek to push issues affecting the health sector to the periphery. Mr Odinga said the country is in a state of crisis at the moment. This is the first time Uhuru is meeting Abiy since Addis Ababa launched a crackdown on TPLF. CJ Maraga is set to officially retire tomorrow after serving as the country’s 14th Chief Justice. Gitau claims he was abducted and taken to a safe house in Gatundu North.
