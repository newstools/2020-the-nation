"We have a lot of offensive firepower," Lakers coach Frank Vogel said.
James, who turns 36 on Wednesday, rose to second on the NBA's all-time Christmas points list with 383, passing Oscar Robertson by six to pull within 12 of matching the late Kobe Bryant's career record.
It was the 10th Christmas victory in 15 holiday appearances by James, who equaled former Miami teammate Dwyane Wade for the most career Christmas NBA wins.





Slovakian star guard Luka Doncic scored 27 points for Dallas, but the Mavericks -- in their first Christmas game since 2011 -- were outscored in every quarter and outrebounded 53-27 by the Lakers in an overpowering effort on a night of blowouts.
Brooklyn's Kyrie Irving and Miami's Duncan Robinson each matched an NBA Christmas record with seven 3-pointers, the Heat stretching their holiday win streak to eight games.
Irving scored 37 points, hitting 7-of-10 3-point attempts in his return to Boston, as the Nets ripped his former Celtics teammates 123-95.
"I'm glad we could put on a performance for everybody," Irving said. "We're definitely going to continue to progress every day."
Robinson finished with 23 points, hitting 7-of-13 from beyond the arc, in leading 2020 NBA runner-up Miami over visiting New Orleans 111-98.

"Getting more and more comfortable every day," Robinson said. "Last year was a great learning experience. We're just trying to build on it. We're happy to get this one."
Also rolling to a holiday triumph were the Milwaukee Bucks, who had a game-high 31 points from Khris Middleton to beat Golden State 138-99 -- the second-most lopsided blowout in NBA Christmas history -- thanks to a 72-43 Bucks edge in the second half.
"It was just moving the ball," said Middleton. "We made some defensive mistakes but we made some adjustments to correct those. We just wanted to put on a show."
At Boston, Jaylen Brown scored 27 points and Jayson Tatum added 22, but Brooklyn's Kevin Durant scored 16 of his 29 in the third quarter and the Nets seized an 86-77 edge before pulling away in the fourth quarter.
The Nets became the first club since the 2008-09 Lakers to win their first two games by 20 or more points.
"We can't exceed our own expectations," Irving said. "We know this is a long journey ahead."
As for his return to Boston, Irving said, "I went to war with those guys. We're going to continue to lean on each other as brothers off the floor and compete on it."
