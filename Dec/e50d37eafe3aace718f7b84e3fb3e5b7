Commuters plying the Lamu-Witu-Garsen route on Monday experienced an unusual delay, just a day after police officers repulsed an attack by suspected Al-Shabaab militants in Nyongoro.
The heavily armed terrorists ambushed the Border Patrol Unit (BPU) Toyota Land Cruiser which was escorting a convoy of buses from Lamu heading to Gamba and Mombasa at around 11.15am on Sunday.

A shootout ensued between the more than 10 officers aboard the police vehicle and the militants and lasted for over 10 minutes before the terrorists were overpowered and fled to the bush.
Speaking to the Nation on Monday, bus drivers, conductors and passengers complained that they were forced to stay for hours at the Kibaoni and Witu road blocks before they were allowed to proceed with their journeys.
"This is abnormal. We're used to waiting for one another for less than 30 minutes so that we can travel in one convoy. But today, we've waited for too long. I suspect all this is because of the attempted Al-Shabaab attack at Nyongoro on Sunday," said Hassan Said, a driver.

Mr Said Swaleh, a conductor with one of the Lamu-bound buses, called on security agencies in the region to come up with strategies that will ensure the safety of passengers while at the same time ensuring there are no delays.
"For the past 10 months, we've been enjoying the travel arrangements on the Lamu-Witu-Garsen road. There have been no delays. We're worried that due to yesterday’s attack, more restrictions will be introduced that will cause delays. I hope that won't be the case," said Mr Swaleh.
Patrols intensified
A spot-check by the Nation established that general security patrols on the Lamu-Witu-Garsen road had also been intensified as police and Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) vehicles kept moving along the various sections of the route, particularly those that are considered to be terror hotspots such as Nyongoro, Lango la Simba, Milihoi and Mambo Sasa.

Mercy Kahindi, a passenger aboard a shuttle heading to Mombasa from Lamu, said they were forced to wait and move in one convoy escorted by armed police officers.
"Shuttles have always been moving without waiting for the convoy of buses. Today, we were asked to wait for buses so that we can move in one convoy under police escort. This is unusual," said Ms Kahindi.
Locals interviewed by the Nation expressed disappointment, saying that the Sunday attempted Al-Shabaab attack at Nyongoro has broken the trust they had over the security of travellers on the road.
"Over 10 months have passed without witnessing any Al-Shabaab incident on our route. This had brought much confidence among travellers that terrorist attacks in Lamu were fading. The Sunday attack came as a shock to us," said Mr Omar Ali.
Travel by air
Other frequent road users said they will have to consider travelling by air rather than using the road and risk getting killed by the militants.
"I now find it hard to believe that we're safe to continue travelling by road. There are security agencies patrolling every place along the road but, unfortunately, Al-Shabaab are still launching attacks. That means the security situation on the Lamu-Garsen route is still questionable. I can't use the road any more. I prefer using air transport since you're guaranteed of your security," said Ms Milcah Kimani.

Contacted, Lamu County Commissioner Irungu Macharia said the county’s security committee will convene an urgent meeting to strategise on travel arrangements on the Lamu-Witu-Garsen route during this festive season.
"Following yesterday’s incident, we're meeting as security stakeholders to find an effective approach that will ensure safety of the commuters plying the Lamu-Witu-Garsen-Mombasa route. I will give details later," said Mr Macharia on Monday.
Shabaab attacks
Between 2014 and 2017, the Lamu-Garsen route witnessed frequent ambushes and attacks by Al-Shabaab militants on security and public transport vehicles plying the road.
A number of security personnel and civilians lost their lives on the route.
The national government was forced to introduce a night travel ban on the route on July 19, 2014 after seven people, including four Administration Police officers, were killed by Al-Shabaab terrorists who ambushed a Tahmeed bus en route to Lamu from Mombasa near Mambo Sasa forest in Witu.
Public service vehicles were instead directed to move in one convoy that is normally accompanied by an armed police escort.
The government also moved in to establish General Service Unit (GSU) and KDF camps at all notorious hotspots along the route.
