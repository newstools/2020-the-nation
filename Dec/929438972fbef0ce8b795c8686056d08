Genes encoding proteins that control the antiviral defences of interferons were found to have early loss of function in severe coronavirus illness. The patients suffer hypoxiaemic symptoms and die from insufficient supply of oxygen. In a study published under accelerated peer review in the journal Nature, the genetic basis for susceptibility to critical Covid-19 illness has been reported.
The virus presents as mild, moderate or severe case and the study found that, critically ill patients have unique pathophysiology. The study recruited 2,444 critically ill patients across 208 intensive care units in the UK.

Using a technology known as genetics of mortality in critical ill care (GeOMICC), the scientists carried out whole blood DNA analysis of blood to perform genome wide associations studies that seek to pinpoint specific genes with disease susceptibility. Two important conclusions were inferred.
First, genes for Covid-19 critical illness are heritable and, therefore, people possessing them were more likely to suffer critical illness when infected with the virus. Secondly, repurposing of existing drugs could potentially reduce mortality in critically ill patients.

Genes encoding proteins that control the antiviral defences of interferons were found to have early loss of function in severe coronavirus illness.
This loss of antiviral defences was associated with high lung burden of Sars-Cov2, the virus causing Covid-19. Paradoxically, administration of exogenous interferon to restore antiviral activities in the lungs of the patients did not improve the patients’ lung capacity, indicating delayed use of synthetic interferons isn’t helpful at advanced stage of the illness.
Pulmonary inflammation
This demonstrates the need to perform GeOMICC tests in patients so that those with mild and moderate illnesses can be put into exogenous interferon treatment since it’s likely to be effective prior to loss of function of interferon genes that occurs with onset of critical illness.

Additionally, the study established increased production of proteins known as chemokines, whose role is to attract inflammatory immune cells in the lungs and lung blood vessels.
In particular, genes for chemokines such as CCR2 (chemokine receptor 2) were over expressed in critically ill patients and so, such had unusual influx of macrophages in the lungs, leading to pulmonary inflammation, which led to reduced capacity of the lungs to allow diffusion of oxygen.
 The patients suffer hypoxiaemic symptoms and die from insufficient supply of oxygen. Treatment of such patients with anti-CCR2 monoclonal antibodies greatly improved the lung capacity and restored oxygen levels.
People with symptoms should be subjected to genetic testing to determine if they have genes for propensity to critical illness so as to put them in treatments that will prevent the disease from advancing to moderate, then to severe level associated with high mortality rates.
