Satellite campuses
 To mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic on its academic calendar, ZJU began virtual teaching on February 24. Just two weeks into this learning experiment, the university was offering more than 5,000 courses to both graduate and undergraduate students.

Digital learning
 How will Kenyan universities gain by fully embracing digital learning? Firstly, it will lead to savings. Even though the initial outlay in technology might be expensive, in the long run it will save money.
 One of the reasons as to why most universities are in the red financially is because of high indebtedness. Huge loans from financial institutions to set up and run satellite campuses across the country have dented their financial positions.
 Secondly, technology can help prepare students for the real world. Education technology can help familiarise students with modern technology and give them experience in the most used applications in work places. Lastly, virtual learning will lead to increased enrollment and consequently increased revenue for universities.
