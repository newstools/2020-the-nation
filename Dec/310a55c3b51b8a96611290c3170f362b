In agreement with the UN women’s report, this year has been like no other. Even before Covid-19 hit, violence against women and girls had reached pandemic proportions with 243 million women and girls having been abused globally by an intimate partner in the past year.
Less than 40 per cent of women who experience violence seek help. The World Health Organization has also reported a high prevalence of GBV during the pandemic. Indeed, GBV has been deprioritised, leaving vulnerable groups at higher risk.

Intimate partners
Physical violence, emotional and psychological abuse, sexual assault, female genital mutilation and economic abuse are some of the common forms of GBV.
The commonest perpetrators of violence are intimate partners, friends, relatives and people familiar with the survivor or victim. Children the world over begin experiencing sexual and physical violence in the hands of people they know well before they become adults.
Many factors intertwine to create a conducive environment for abuse of the vulnerable. Self-identity crises, poverty, ignorance and peer pressure are pre-disposing factors for GBV all reinforced by slow legal systems, cultural norms such as FGM, inferior treatment of women.

Victims experience blame, shame and stigma in most cases causing long-term negative effects on their physical and mental health. It becomes a barrier to social, political and economic development.
These experiences cause an increased likelihood of poor mental health manifested by anxiety, depression, suicide, homicide, psychoactive substance abuse and further violence to mention but a few.
We need to cultivate a culture of mutual respect and gender equality. Taking pro-active steps in addressing GBV will safeguard the physical and mental health of women and girls.
