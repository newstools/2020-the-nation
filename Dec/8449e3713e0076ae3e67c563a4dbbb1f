Mr Maangi, Ruto’s pointman in Gusii, said the meeting was meant to unite leaders allied to the DP.Just last month, Mr Maangi pledged to work with Dr Matiang’i in what he said will help galvanise the unity of Abagusii. Deputy President William Ruto has held talks with leaders from Kisii and Baringo counties in an effort to solidify his support.
The DP met Baringo leaders yesterday and on Thursday, he had held talks with Gusii leaders. In Kisii, the leaders have been reading from different scripts, especially after his decision to shun leading the “No” side of the BBI referendum.

In his continued charm offensive against his political opponents, Mr Ruto hopes to put his house in order in what he believes will lay a road map for a strong support base in the region come 2022.
The DP met the about 20 leaders from Kisii County at his Karen residence in Nairobi led by Kisii deputy governor Joash Maangi, MPs Silvanus Osoro (South Mugirango) and Alpha Miruka (Bomachoge Chache).
Unite leaders
Former Constitutional Implementation Commission chairman Charles Nyachae, former Kenya Ports Authority managing director Daniel Manduku and former Bonchari MP Zebedeo Opore were the other attendants.

Mr Maangi, Ruto’s pointman in Gusii, said the meeting was meant to unite leaders allied to the DP.
The Thursday meeting was also meant to lay political strategies post-Covid-19. This is after the DP counselled a series of meetings in the region last month due to the health crisis.
“The DP had organised at least eight meetings in Kisii last month. But Covid-19 cases increased and he had to stop. He has agreed to proceed with the meetings as soon as infections reduce,” said Mr Maangi.
The deputy governor said though the leaders who met the DP support him, they differ on a number of issues amongst them the Building Bridges Initiative.

Support BBI
“For example, I support the BBI, Mr Nyachae does not. The meeting reminded us that our goal was DP’s support and that is where we should focus,” said Mr Maangi.
Another issue is Mr Maangi’s support for Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i.
“Many are wondering why I was in Karen the other day, just a month after declaring my support for our son, Dr Matiang’i. The CS has not declared interest for presidency, Ruto has. There is no conflict there. I support Matiang’i in his bid to unite our Abagusii community,” said Mr Maangi.
Just last month, Mr Maangi pledged to work with Dr Matiang’i in what he said will help galvanise the unity of Abagusii.
In a surprise move that has left his supporters in confusion, analysts said the political about-turn by Mr Maangi was a blow to Mr Ruto, who has been banking on him to get support in Gusii.
Mr Maangi made the unexpected declaration in Nyagesenda SDA church, in Kitutu Chache North, during a function attended by his boss, Governor James Ongwae, the man he's had on and off relationship.
