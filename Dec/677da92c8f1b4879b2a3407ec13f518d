Isiolo Woman Rep Rehema Jaldesa has declared her intention to battle it out with Governor Mohamed Kuti for the county’s top seat in the 2022 General Election.
The vocal first term MP is being fronted as the most suitable and sellable candidate to the public due to her laudable development track record and influence in her vote-rich Borana community.

The Deputy President William Ruto’s ally, who is known for making candid and controversial statements without fear of repercussions, has already said she will not vie against her ally, Senator Fatuma Dullo, whom she said has demonstrated exemplary leadership.
“I and Fatuma cannot vie for that single (Senate) seat. One of us will vie for governor while the other for senator,” she said during a Kenya Women Parliamentary Association (Kewopa) training in Isiolo town that brought together over 100 women leaders from across the county.





Women caucus
The Nation has learnt that a women's caucus, with representatives from all communities, has already been formed to coordinate campaign activities for various women contestants who will vie for all elective positions as the leaders seek to introduce what they term as women's leadership from top to bottom.
Locals view the statement by Ms Jaldesa, who in the past never signalled any intention to vie for the governor’s seat and who many thought would seek an MP’s post, as being meant to joggle people’s minds and lure them to supporting a woman for the top county seat.
Having been in leadership for over 15 years, Governor Kuti, locally nicknamed doctor of politics due to his excellent convincing skills, is not the man one is likely to unseat without strain and sweat.

Hidden card
At the same time, even though Senator Dullo has in the past distanced herself from the gubernatorial seat, if her past meetings with various community groups are anything to go by, she could be holding a hidden card.
Ms Joyce Nairisiae, the chairperson of Samburu Council of Elders in Isiolo, said based on their past development records, both MPs are fit to serve Isiolo residents in the governor’s capacity.
“The governor’s post needs a woman. If Rehema has done a lot with little resources, she can achieve immense development with the billions that the county receives,” said Ms Nairisiae.
With key political decisions majorly made by council of elders, Ms Nairisiae said they have the numbers to enable their candidate triumph at the ballot.
“We are putting men occupying elective posts on notice that they are doing nothing. Even with traditions, we are not joking and we have the numbers,” she said.
Most suitable candidate
The legislator said the steering group will nominate the most suitable candidate who will then be presented to the council of elders for endorsement lobbying.
“We have carried men on our backs for five years and it is their turn to carry us on their backs. If we fail to deliver, then we will resign but this county needs a woman who can take care of the needs of all,” Ms Jaldesa said.

Politician Lucy Mworia, who has expressed interest in the Isiolo North MP’s seat, said they will rally youths and men to their side in order to have a solid team as the polls approach.
She asked women to support their own who will be seeking various elective posts.
Whether the plan works or not will be determined by two things — endorsement by the elders and support by the community and, of course, the alignments.
Like in other pastoralist counties, clan elders offer political direction and fair distribution of positions with the dominant clans bagging the top seats in what is termed as negotiated democracy.
But if what happened in Mandera in 2017 — where Governor Ali Roba defied the elders and went ahead to clinch the seat — is anything to go by, then there is light at the end of the tunnel especially for candidates who view negotiated democracy as prohibitive. But time will tell.
