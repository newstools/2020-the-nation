Year 2020 was marked by the locust invasion, floods and drought, and a staggering economy, helped into the abyss by Covid-19 devastation.We are staring at a Sh8.4 trillion debt against a ceiling of Sh9 trillion. It may sound insincere to send you the traditional Happy New Year goodwill message against the backdrop of the times we live in, our bitter experience this year, and an uncertain 2021.
However, it’s in times of gloom like we live in now that the true character of a Kenyan is manifested. Kenyans are generally warm, optimistic and resilient people. I cannot take it past them that they are looking at 2020 as a memory and 2021 with hope. This is the spirit that has seen Kenyans overcome untold misery meted on them by nature and inconsiderate governments.

We cannot, therefore, wipe away the Christmas smile and New Year cheer from Kenyan faces even under the torrid conditions of ravaging Covid-19 and real destitution. Year 2020 was marked by the locust invasion, floods and drought, and a staggering economy, helped into the abyss by Covid-19 devastation. It’s not easy to recount the personal anguish of Kenyans, without feeling guilty; as leaders, we did nothing meaningful to halt and arrest the hurt.

Civid-19 did not cause our economic decay, but only accelerated it. The warnings we were digging the wrong hole economically were always there. We went into a borrowing binge that upset our dwindling balance of payments. But the more dangerous the debt exposure we run into, the more borrowing we signed onto until the troubles we face today exploded.
Structural Adjustment Programmes
We are staring at a Sh8.4 trillion debt against a ceiling of Sh9 trillion. The country is on the chopping block of bankruptcy because we borrowed expensive commercial loans with high yielding interest in a very short time. With corruption skimming its share, we invested in flashy projects without guaranteed immediate returns. Worse would come when loans investment was not yielding returns to pay back.

Because borrowing from Peter to pay Tom cannot be sustained, we have been pushed back into the era of debilitating Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs). SAPs were extremely devastating because of retrenchment in public service and cost-sharing in access to government services, which sprouted corruption. The county is now painfully renegotiating how to reschedule is debts lest it defaults.
This comes with extremely penalising demands for government — to make budget cuts by retrenching workers, and raising taxes. Already, about 70,000 public servants are targeted.
Conditions to access World Bank and IMF loans are already manifesting in removal of tax reductions extended as stimulus mitigation against Covid-19. VAT is back to its maximum 16 per cent, with a consequent rise in unaffordable prices of basic consumer goods.
High taxes
Just to demonstrate how hamstrung the government is, new high taxes are being applied to already impoverished and reduced tax base due to job losses and many business closures.
Though no indication yet on where government will apply budget cuts, the loans-guzzling mega edifices appear safe, magnified by increased gusto to showcase transport infrastructure projects.

But under threat are the social welfare monthly money transfer programmes to the indigent, widows and orphans, the women and youth funds, and even the highly valued Universal Health Care (UHC) programme. Next will be removal of all subsidies.

}, 62000);
}



Meanwhile, government is struggling to meet monthly wage commitments. Disbursements to county governments are lagging behind. Promises to refurbish schools for Covid-19-free reopening in January are just that, promises. Picketing health workers’ demands for basic safety measures against Covid-19 are dismissed.
National security threat
Ironically, Kenya puts a premium on education, but has shortage of teachers, while thousands of their trained ranks are unemployed. And government threatens to sack health workers in the midst of a pandemic and implementation of UHC. Desperation leading to increase in taxes is understandable.
But does government know it is taxing equally desperate, poor and sick people? People are sick and unproductive because they don’t have jobs and cannot get treated in hospitals.
Before, good counsel prevailed; arrogance, threats and intimidation did not get patients admitted to hospitals since government had refused to talk staff welfare.

A paralysed heath system is a national security threat. Recent government inactions and actions abet Covid-19 spread and infections. Austerity measures should not immobilise key sectors of agriculture, manufacturing, health, education and social support schemes.
While politicians have their diaries marked out for 2021, most Kenyans are staring at a void after losing their livelihoods in 2020.
Covid-19 is unrelenting as fatigue competes with anti-Covid-19 rules. I plead with fellow Kenyans not to relax in protecting themselves against Covid-19. Protecting oneself can’t be enforced; it is self-discipline.
Vaccines may be on the way, but will not be useful to those already Covid-19 positive. Despite empty pockets, wear a mask, wash hands, keep your distance. Avoid crowded places to which politicians are likely to draw you without protection. Jubilee and OMD have submitted names to the IEBC amid talks of cooperation. Impeached Waititu and exiled Miguna are also in the contest. They have joined nurses and clinicians in their strike, a decision that will further paralyse services in public hospitals. A six-tonne consignment of drugs wasted away at the airport for three years because government officials differed over its clearance.
