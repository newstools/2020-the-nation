In Kenya for instance, youth in the 18-35 age bracket constitute about 40 per cent of the population with the number projected to increase.Kenya should realise the goals articulated in the strategy by creating infrastructure and networks to educate and involve youth in activities related to global trade, diplomacy, sustainability and peace-building. There has been heightened activities by the global players to create common grounds to promote prosperity as well as address a myriad of problems facing humanity in the wake of growing technology that has increasingly made the world a global village in recent years.
Unfortunately for young people, who hold key to the success of the ongoing initiatives, due to their sheer numbers, technological advancement and their roles in today’s social economic order have largely been ignored at the diplomatic level.

The global conversation cuts across a range of issues that include peace negotiations, climate change, trade deals and domestic political decision-making processes that shape global engagement.
It is imperative that youth are given the opportunities to participate in international institutions and processes where they can share ideas to resolve global issues.

There is strong justification for this due to the impacts of the decision made at the global arena on youth. In Kenya for instance, youth in the 18-35 age bracket constitute about 40 per cent of the population with the number projected to increase.
Kenya can also set a good example as a good global ambassador by turning to President Kenyatta as a focal point in his role as the UN Global Leader for young people.
Appropriate skills
With youth comes energy, innovation, and optimism such that, if a supportive environment and opportunity exists, they can transform the world.
On the other hand, alienated, frustrated, marginalised, and excluded youth, who cannot contribute to any nation’s agenda, is a huge loss to humanity.
Kenya has suffered significantly due to youth-led extremism and violence, which has been categorised as a global challenge. This should bolster our move to facilitate the younger generations with appropriate skills required to excel in the field of international relations.

A key policy measure required in facilitating youth engagement is education reforms. In Kenya, the secondary school curriculum does not adequately cover international politics and diplomacy, leaving youth — notably those from rural areas — unaware of the significance of foreign relations and the international community in transforming societies.
The role of media, both mainstream and social, is also critical in enhancing youth space in the global arena. However, a question arises on whether the media has been more active in inciting and manipulating youth rather than moulding them in the right manner.
Social media and other modern means of communication have enabled terrorist groups and individuals to promote their extremist ideologies amongst youth across the globe with ease. It is important to help young people to use social media for good deeds and to advance diplomacy.
Now more than ever, the media has a high level of responsibility to maintain the integrity of information disseminated to keep youth informed about the necessity of their engagement in effective diplomacy, while ensuring that they are not influenced by exposure to extremist ideologies.

Optimal engagement
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs youth mainstreaming action plan is a good starting point for a positive diplomacy where it reaffirms that young people are an essential asset worth investing in –recognizes youth as a vital resource and integral stakeholder in the development process and a key determinant in shaping the Country’s future thus, the need to ensure optimal engagement and participation to be able to tap the immense creativity and energy of youth.

The strategy incorporates the role of youth in development initiatives and significant contribution to the overall economic development and diplomacy. At its core, the strategy aims to provide a blueprint for joint initiatives and implementation of effective practices before it is too late.
It also outlines of ensuring protection and support for young people, and provides a platform through which their “needs can be addressed, their voice can be amplified, and their engagement can be advanced.
Kenya should realise the goals articulated in the strategy by creating infrastructure and networks to educate and involve youth in activities related to global trade, diplomacy, sustainability and peace-building.
The more challenging goal will be enacting long-term policy reforms that empower youth and provide them with skills sets to confidently navigate the world of international politics, before negative consequences of lack of youth engagement in diplomacy manifests.
