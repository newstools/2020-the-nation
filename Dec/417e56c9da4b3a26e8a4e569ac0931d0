In the past, Olunga has not hidden his love for Arsenal. He recorded a video of himself in December 2015 and posted on YouTube requesting Frenchman Arsene Wenger for a chance to play for Arsenal.“Hi Arsene Wenger. I’m Michael Olunga Ogada, a striker at Gor Mahia FC which is in Kenya. I’m currently the best player in Kenya. I’ve scored 38 goals all season and my dream is to play for Arsenal,” said Olunga, who was 21 at the time. Kenyan international Michael Olunga has ruled out a move to Europe next season saying he is not leaving Kashiwa Reysol when Japan’s pre-season window opens next month.
Speculation has been rife that the 26-year-old could soon head to Europe or even Australia after putting in some excellent performances for two consecutive years in Japan .

});
}, 62000);
}



When asked in an online interview on Monday by Japanese news outlet, Mainichi, whether he will play for Kashiwa next season, Olunga replied he still has a contract with Reysol.
“I don't want to talk about transfers or anything like that. Now, I'm working hard for Reysol as a member of Reysol.”
His contract was supposed to end on January 31, 2021, but Kashiwa moved with speed to tie him down with a new two-year contract. Olunga’s new improved contract at Kashiwa lapses on January 31, 2023, but that has not stopped him being linked with moves out of Japan.





With the mid-season transfer window for the ‘Big Five’ European leagues (Spanish La Liga, English Premier League, Italian Serie A, German Bundesliga and French Ligue 1) opening on January 1, 2021, any club will have to part with huge fees to get the services of the lethal striker “if he changes his mind”.    
Love for Arsenal
Local football enthusiasts have urged Olunga to move to Europe. He was even linked with moves to Turkey and France in the last European transfer window.

Kenyans are huge followers of the English Premier League and hoping to see Olunga on their television screens, they have for two years been urging him to ditch the Japanese league saying “it is not competitive”.

Olunga has not responded to those requests which normally flood his social media pages when he posts something.
In the past, Olunga has not hidden his love for Arsenal. He recorded a video of himself in December 2015 and posted on YouTube requesting Frenchman Arsene Wenger for a chance to play for Arsenal.
“Hi Arsene Wenger. I’m Michael Olunga Ogada, a striker at Gor Mahia FC which is in Kenya. I’m currently the best player in Kenya. I’ve scored 38 goals all season and my dream is to play for Arsenal,” said Olunga, who was 21 at the time.
Olunga hoped Wenger would consider his request and was even ready to join the feeder team.
“I’ll be sure to repay you for having faith in me. Thanks for considering my options,” he said.
Golden Boot
If he ever goes to Europe, it will not be his first time. When his request to Wenger failed, he found a new home in Swedish top-tier side Djurgardens IF in February 2016. Olunga has also played in La Liga for Girona on a season-long loan from Chinese outfit Guizhou Zhicheng.
He left Guizhou for Kashiwa on August 2018 and has been in scintillating form ever since.
Olunga scored 27 goals and provided nine assists in 2019 as coach Nelsinho’s side returned to the big-league as second-tier champions.

Olunga leads the Golden Boot race in 2020 J1 League after notching 26 goals, nine ahead of his closest rival Brazilian Everaldo of Kashima Antlers. Olunga has also made four assists.

He could improve on his number of goals or assists before the season ends as Kashiwa still has dates against Sanfrecce Hiroshima (December 16) and champions Kawasaki Frontale (December 19).   Kashiwa remain seventh on 49 points after the draw at Cerezo. They have no victory in their last four home matches. Mr Noordin Haji terms last week’s decision unfair and without any factual or legal bases. Ms Agnes Wangui said in court papers that the Matungu MP sired two children with her. The televangelist was charged with killing the woman by dangerous driving.
