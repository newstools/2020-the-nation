The Catholic Church has appealed to the government to release the desks that were promised to various learning institutions in a bid to enhance social distancing when schools reopen in January.
Bishop Paul Kariuki, the chairman of the Catholic Commission for Education and Religious Education, said many institutions have not received the promised government assistance to help in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.

Tenders for making of the desks were awarded by President Uhuru Kenyatta mid this year.
Speaking in Embu, the prelate also appealed to the government to extend assistance to private schools, saying many are struggling following the closure in March, and some may not even re-open.
Help private schools
Bishop Kariuki noted that private schools play a key role in the education sector and should be assisted to stay afloat so as to help ease congestion in public schools.

});
}, 62000);
}



He noted that some private school owners had been driven out of business due to harsh economic times, while others are struggling and some candidates could be inconvenienced.
“The government should know that there are no private students. Maybe there are mission (church owned) schools that need assistance. Private schools cannot be forced to stay in business if they do not have the capacity to operate.
“The government should work on how to help the private institutions since if they are closed, public schools could be overcrowded,” said Bishop Kariuki.
He at the same time urged parents to establish the status of the schools near them so as to know whether they are still in operation in order not to be shocked at the last minute.

Buy enough face masks
He also appealed to the parents to ensure they buy enough face masks for their children and always monitor their progress so that if they need medication, they are attended to fast.
“Parents should buy their children at least four re-usable face masks. Schools boards of management should also ensure that the environment is conducive for learning and get isolation rooms in case students fall ill while in school. Parents should also bear the responsibility of taking care of their children who fall ill,” advised the bishop.
Bishop Kariuki also appealed to the TSC to replace teachers who have retired.
