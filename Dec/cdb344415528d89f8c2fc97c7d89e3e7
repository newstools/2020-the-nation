We have reacted with fury and outrage to each episode, vowing that o stone will be left unturned in the search for justice.Both the president and his deputy saw in the fresh Kinoti investigation the potential for ethnic conflict. The matter could be considered close once President Uhuru Kenyatta rightly chastised Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti over the controversial move to re-open investigations into the 2007-2008 post-election violence.
Many were concerned that in revisiting the cases, Mr Kinoti was engaged more in game of political brinkmanship targeting Deputy President William Ruto rather than a genuine attempt to find and punish the perpetrators, win justice for the victims and deter new bouts of political acts of violence.

Dr Ruto certainly saw it that way. He responded that he was the target of a scheme to derail his 2022 presidential ambitions. He accused the Jubilee government, of which he is second-in-command, of acting in desperation after being exposed by his hustler movement for poor leadership and inability to tackle youth poverty and unemployment.

The DP’s supporters were quickly mobilised to come out in his defence, accusing Mr Kinoti of inciting ethnic animosities in the Rift Valley electoral violence hotspots.
Quite notable was them charging that the DCI was not acting on his own initiative, but as mere agent for powerful political forces out to undermine Dr Ruto by reviving ethnic hostilities in in his political strongholds. No names were mentioned, but it was easy to see that the target of their ire was none other than President Kenyatta.
Political assassinations
The president obviously saw the political ramifications and inherent dangers in re-opening investigations into the worst bout electoral violence in independent Kenya, where over 1,300 people were killed and hundreds of thousands run out of their homes.
He was absolutely right to tell off Mr Kinoti for a most unwise action and effectively scupper fresh investigations into the violence. Yet in reactions from both the Kenyatta and Ruto factions, we see exactly why there will never be closure and sustained peace unless the causes of cyclic political and ethnic violence are addressed.

Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto and four others were hauled before the International Criminal Court to face charges of crimes against humanity out of the 2007-2008 election violence. There were seen as commanders on opposite sides of the warring forces, but the ICC indictments made them unite against a common foe.
They now come with the tired ‘don’t open old wounds’ mantra. The reality, however is that a festering, cancerous wound cannot be cured unless it is first opened up and properly cauterised.
Kenya has experienced painful periods in political assassinations such as befell Pio Gama Pinto (1965), Tom Mboya (1969) and JM Kariuki(1975); ethnic-political violence such the 2017-2018 episode under reference or similar bloodshed earlier in 1997 and 1990-1991; or mass murder by security forces such as the Wagalla massacre of 1984.

With the passage of time, however, we quietly agree to forget and move on.
That is the attitude which breeds impunity, and gives those of evil minds the confidence to commit more bloody acts knowing that they will never be brought to justice. Both the president and his deputy saw in the fresh Kinoti investigation the potential for ethnic conflict.

Swept under the carpet
We therefore need no further proof that the embers of bloody carnage are just simmering below the surface.
It exposes the lie in the argument that the Uhuru-Ruto political union which drove a triumphant presidential election campaign in 2013 secured a lasting peace between their respective communities.
If peace depends on a political accommodation between two individuals, that peace will not survive a divorce. That is the stark reality which must be addressed.
Mr Kinoti’s intervention was clearly ill-advised and ill-intentioned insofar as it was seen to be politically-driven.
But if there are fresh threats to violence in the Rift Valley or elsewhere, that information cannot be swept under the carpet. Professional and impartial investigations must be launched without delay and any such plans nipped in the bud.
If our Directorate of Criminal Investigations cannot be entrusted with the delicate task, then it might be time to bring in competent agencies from outside who are not embedded with any of our ethnic political formations.
We must also move with haste to reopen and resolve all past crimes. Unless there is full acknowledgment that crimes were committed, the perpetrators identified, and the underlying causes addressed, we will never have peace, only a temporary ceasefire as prevails at the moment.

Only when we have courage to confront the bloody sores of the past can we move forward to crafting solutions for lasting peace and harmony.
