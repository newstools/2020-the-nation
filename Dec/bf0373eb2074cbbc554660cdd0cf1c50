The bridge has a 150-metre movable section mid-ocean, to allow for opening and closing.The bridge also comprises a 529-metre long floating section and 54-metre long approaches on either side of the floating span. President Uhuru Kenyatta will Thursday officially commission the Sh1.9 billion Likoni Floating bridge.
Residents of Mombasa have been eagerly waiting the commissioning of the bridge which stretches from Liwatoni in Mombasa to Ras Bofu (Peleleza) in Likoni.
The Head of State will be accompanied by visiting Ethiopia Prime Minister Dr Abiy Ahmed during the launch at Liwatoni in Mombasa, according to communication from State House.

Ease congestion
The 1.2 kilometer pedestrian bridge, Ms Dena said, is a first of its kind in the region and is designed to ease congestion at the Likoni channel.
She said the launch of the project will ease pressure on ferries at the Likoni channel which will be left to serve vehicular and cargo crossing between Mombasa Island and the South Coast.
The bridge has a 150-metre movable section mid-ocean, to allow for opening and closing and ease the movement of ships in and out of the Mombasq port.
The upper section of the bridge comprises lattice steel designed from prefabricated parts with a movable main steel structure.
The bridge also comprises a 529-metre long floating section and 54-metre long approaches on either side of the floating span, according to the designs.

A pile foundation is formed by long, slender, columnar elements typically made from steel or reinforced concrete. 
The bridge is expected to be dismantled and taken to Lamu or any other place after the government constructs the Mombasa Gateway Bridge which will be a permanent project. The bridge is expected to help deal with at least 50 percent of pedestrian congestion at the Likoni channel. The bridge is part of the government’s plans to ease human traffic at the Likoni channel in a bid to stem the spread of Covid-19. Ms Nthenya was freed without any charges being preferred against her. Just last week, Justice James Rika recused himself from the case after tempers flared in court.
