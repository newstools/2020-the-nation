The diplomatic tension between Kenya and Somalia is a concern for the African Union, the AU Commission has said, and urged talks between the two countries.
The AU has warned against Somalia’s rising antagonism towards Kenya, saying it could jeopardise regional security.
AUC Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat addressed the matter on Sunday during the 38th Extra-Ordinary Summit of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad), that took place in Djibouti.

He said Somalia and Kenya should resolve their differences through dialogue to ensure the regional cooperation against Al-Shabaab and other challenges is not disrupted.
Mr Faki noted that the two countries share a long history of good neighbourliness.
“Kenya, it should be noted, is a troop-contributing country to Amisom, and hosts a large community of Somali refugees,” he said, referring to the AU forces in Somalia, to which the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) has sent troops.

Known as the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom), the forces are meant to stabilise the country and work under the mandate of the UN Security Council.
“I’m convinced that the long-standing and strong links between the two countries and peoples can overcome the current challenges,” Mr Faki said.
Drastic move
The summit was called to discuss matters including the humanitarian situation in Tigray, Ethiopia, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic in Africa, but it came amid tensions between Somalia and Kenya. 
The relationship between the two countries has continued to deteriorate, with President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo threatening to expel Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) troops who are part of Amisom.
Farmaajo's threat comes days after Somalia expelled Kenyan diplomats in a memo sent to Nairobi at 1am.

Last week, Somalia terminated diplomatic ties with Kenya, alleging interference in its internal affairs by Nairobi.
Somalia has gone on to accuse Kenya of arming ‘militia’ in Somalia, a charge Nairobi has rejected.
On Friday, Defence CS Monica Juma cancelled a press conference at Kenya Army Headquarters at the eleventh hour.
Somalia's drastic move came as Nairobi hosted Somaliland President Muse Bihi, with whom Kenya agreed to start direct flights and set up a consulate in Hargeisa by March.
Farmaajo’s reaction baffled many since his administration had endorsed Kenya’s application to set up a diplomatic outpost in Hargeisa.
Troops issue
In public, Mr Faki called for dialogue but the AU is also opposed to the idea of Somalia trying to force out Kenyan troops attached to Amisom, as suggested by the Somali government last week, for fear of having the region relapse to more Al-Shabaab attacks.
“The recent tensions between Somalia and Kenya, two neighbouring countries, which led to the breakdown of diplomatic relations, remain a serious concern for the African Union,” he said.
“I would, therefore, like to call on the two parties to open dialogue with a view to the resumption of these relations, and ask Igad to strongly encourage them in this regard.”

The AUC chair’s speech came at Igad’s first physical summit since March, when the region reported the first cases of Covid-19. The region has now reported about 290,000 cases and more than 5,300 deaths.
Igad brings together the East African nations of Ethiopia, Sudan, Djibouti, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda.
As leaders gathered to discuss the pandemic, tensions between Igad members punctuated the agenda.
The host, Djibouti President Ismail Omar Guelleh, said the meeting reflected the “unity and cohesion that has always characterised” the region.
Ethiopia and Sudan, however, have unending border clashes between their people.
Progress made
The summit was called by Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, the current chair of the Igad Assembly.
Speaking just before the leaders retreated into a closed door session, Prime Minister Hamdok said the meeting was called to discuss ongoing regional peace and security processes in Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia.
In his welcoming remarks, President Guelleh applauded the nations for progress made in the search for sustainable peace and stability in the region, despite disruptions posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and other setbacks such as floods and the desert locust invasion.

Farmaajo and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed were among leaders who attended the summit.
President Uhuru Kenyatta travelled to Djibouti on Sunday morning, accompanied by Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Raychelle Omamo.
South Sudan and Uganda were represented, respectively, by Vice President Rebecca Garang and ambassador to Djibouti Rebecca Otengo.
PM Abiy, who held a meeting with PM Hamdok, said, “historic ties” between Kenya and Somalia mean their issue will be ironed out. He noted that the “strength of our region” is based on cooperation
Mr Faki also spoke about Ethiopia, urging member States to assist the country in dealing with the humanitarian crisis arising from its conflict with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front.
