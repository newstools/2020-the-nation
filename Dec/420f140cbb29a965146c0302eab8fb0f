Kanu, the independence party led by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, is riding on a series of political activities across the country, aimed at popularising the Building Bridges Initiative report, in an attempt to revamp itself ahead of the 2022 General Election.
Hoping to play a key role in midwifing the next political dispensation in the country, Mr Moi has intensified nationwide campaigns in support of the BBI proposals.

But in the shadows of those campaigns, he is crafting an elaborate plan to further revitalise Kanu to take on Deputy President William Ruto for the country’s top seat.
“We are revamping our grassroots networks through continuous engagements with our party members across the country,” he told the Nation.
“For instance, we recently held a county delegates meeting in Nyeri which culminated in a sensitisation campaign to keep people abreast of the reform agenda espoused in the Building Bridges Initiative report.”

Recruitment drive
Baringo Woman Representative Gladwell Tungo said Kanu is “joining President Uhuru Kenyatta in popularising the BBI to ensure our members don’t get confused”, and that the independence party is “a sleeping lion” that still has a lot of political verve.
The Nakuru branch Organising Secretary, Kimani Wa Kimani, said they have also embarked on a membership recruitment drive under the ‘Kanu-Fresh’ slogan.
The party has branches in 41 counties, way above the legally required representation in 25 such units.
Buoyed by a post-election pact with the ruling Jubilee Party, Senator Moi has since intensified political activities across the country, and has also been the target of several other political suitors as the 2022 political realignments take shape.

The strong ties between the Moi and Kenyatta families, which date back to the 1960s, have also played to Senator Moi’s advantage.
