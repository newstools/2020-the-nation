A robbery suspect wanted for more than 10 robberies in Ruaraka has been charged with armed robbery at Makadara Law Courts in Nairobi.
Kelly Ochieng was charged with violently robbing Livingstone Otieno of a mobile phone and Sh500 while armed with a knife during what is said to be a door-to-door robbery in Kasabuni estate on September 12, 2020.

Ochieng and his seven accomplices knocked at Otieno’s door before they broke in after he declined to open, police said. Otieno could only identify three, including Ochieng, who allegedly stabbed him all over his body.
His accomplices ransacked Otieno’s house while he went on stabbing him, police said. Otieno raised the alarm during the robbery but nobody responded until police arrived at the scene, police said.
The officers took him to Kenyatta National Hospital where he was admitted for two days.

Police said Ochieng was wanted for more robberies before he robbed Otieno and he committed others thereafter while still being sought.
Ochieng was arrested by police officers on patrol and allegedly found with a knife and  32 rolls of bhang.
After Ochieng was taken to the Ruaraka Police Station, police identified him as the suspect behind a series of robberies. He admitted that his accomplices had robbed Otieno during police investigations, police said.
Ochieng was also charged with possession of narcotics.
He denied the charges before Senior Principal Magistrate Angelo Kithinji.
The suspect was freed on a Sh500,000 bond with a surety of similar amount without an option of cash bail. The case will be mentioned on January 11, 2021.
