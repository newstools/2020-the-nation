The EACC has summoned Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi to record a statement on allegations of falsifying information in the self-declaration forms he submitted for the 2017 General Election.
Following issuance of the summons on November 30, Mr Maangi said he will appear at the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission as required on Wednesday.

"The commission, pursuant to its constitutional and statutory mandate, is investigating allegations of falsifying information provided in your self-declaration forms submitted to the EACC for the 2017 General Election, and swearing a false declaration," read the summons.
"The Commission would like you to respond to these allegations and record a statement regarding the same. To this end, you are required to appear at the EACC headquarters, Nairobi."
EACC officers Derrick Kaisha and Pius Ndiwa will take the DG's statement.

Maangi's claim
Mr Maangi said he will go the EACC but alleged malice, saying the allegation of falsifying information emanated from a traffic violation in the US.
He termed the allegation baseless and said he will demand sufficient proof from his accusers.
However, an online verification of what constitutes a criminal offence in the US shows that traffic violations don't qualify to be on anyone's criminal record.
Based on the State in which one resides, traffic violations that would lead to criminal indictment include causing death by dangerous driving, and driving under the influence of alcohol or dangerous drugs. The decision by Joash Maangi, who is Kisii deputy governor, is a blow to Dr Ruto, who has been banking on him in seeking the people’s support. He said he will fight for his freedom of association by all means. The Treasury CS last week announced that temporary Covid-19 tax reliefs will expire at the end of the year.
