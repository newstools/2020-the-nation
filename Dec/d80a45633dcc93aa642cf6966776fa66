GBV undermines the health, dignity and security of its victims, yet it remains shrouded in a culture of silence.GBV knows no social, economic or national boundaries. Gender-based violence (GBV) is an immensely rooted issue globally. Both women and men experience it, but the threat significantly increases for women and girls. It’s entrenched in gender inequality, stereotypes, the abuse of power and harmful norms due to lack of discourse.
GBV knows no social, economic or national boundaries. It’s a global pandemic that affects one in three women in their lifetime.

According to The World Bank Report, September 2019, GBV plagues communities worldwide where 35 per cent of women experience either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence.
Globally, seven per cent of women have been sexually assaulted by someone other than a partner, 38 per cent of murders of women are committed by an intimate partner and 200 million women have experienced female genital mutilation.

GBV undermines the health, dignity and security of its victims, yet it remains shrouded in a culture of silence. GBV comes into two interlinked categories, that is, interpersonal and structural violence.
Interpersonal violence
Interpersonal violence is an act of economic, sexual, psychological or other violence perpetrated by an individual against another individual while structural violence entails inequality discrimination that maintains a person in a subordinate position, whether physical or ideological to other people within the society.
Both categories involve the prioritisation of hegemonic masculinities above the rights of other gendered identities. It is manifested through forced marriage of young girls, FGM, female infanticide, male rape, violence directed at lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, verbal abuse, laws and regulations that limit women’s and girls’ rights and access to services.

});
}, 62000);
}



These practices are not only violations of the human rights of the individuals, but also an instrumentalist approach to sustain the status quo and the hierarchy of gender identities. Women living in poverty are particularly susceptible as they face high levels of structural violence, including difficulty accessing health and legal services needed to address the effects of interpersonal GBV.
Potential female leaders
Men have not been spared either. Reports indicate that men have also had their share of GBV through spousal verbal harassment, bodily harm and injury including their private parts being chopped off, denied food and other basic necessities.
Men have also been falsely accused of rape and attempted rape of their daughters or other girls, close female friends and relatives in order to settle scores.
At the work place, senior male officers have been falsely accused of enticing women sexually and have seen a backlash from women folk. Likewise junior male officers have been reprimanded for suggestive looks by their seniors. The worst bit is that authorities and community in general look down on men when they report such cases.

It has been reported that 42 per cent of women internet users in Africa have experienced some form of online GBV, many a times unaddressed. On social media, men and women have been GBV targets. Political leadership remains a mirage to many women, who suffer all manner of abuse from competitors and the voters.

Meanwhile, Covid-19 has robbed individuals, families and organisations of their livelihoods. Working from home has resulted in more cases of GBV. A country that does not fight for equality in treatment of their men and women will certainly lag behind in development.
