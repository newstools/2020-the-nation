In the process, a colleague of the injured officer, identified as Corporal Solomon Kipchumba, responded to the cries for help but was also attacked by the student who cut him on his lower lip.
The officer then rushed to Ugunja Police Station to report the attack.

“He took away her phone and called the man who had invited the lady to the party and asked him to live his wife alone,” he said.
It was after the phone call that the woman went berserk, breaking household items before reportedly attacking the officer.
“Police officers from Ugunja Police Station rushed to the scene led by the OCS and the injured policemen were taken to Inuka Hospital for treatment,” he said.
Corporal Kipchumba was treated and discharged while his colleague was referred to Sagam Hospital for specialised care because his condition was critical.
