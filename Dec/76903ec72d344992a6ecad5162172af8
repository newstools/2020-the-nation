A month after the launch of a Sh3 billion road project that will cut across Murang’a and Nyandarua counties, property prices have doubled. 

The 68-kilometre-long Kinyona-Gatura-Njabini road has seen land prices along the route skyrocket as speculators descend on the area. 

While at the end of 2018, an acre in the nearby towns of Gataka-ini, Mwagu, Kiarutara, Kimandi, Ndakaini, Ndunyu ya Chege, Gatunyu, Gatura, Kimakia, Kirwara, Kiunyu and Kihumbu-ini all in Gatanga Sub-County averaged between Sh500,000 and Sh2 million, the price has risen to between Sh1 million and Sh4 million.

Gatanga MP Nduati Ngugi projects that at this rate, by 2023, the value will have risen to between Sh6 million and Sh24 million as accrued investments take shape. 

Rates for a single room rental have started improving from between Sh800 and Sh2,000 to between Sh1,200 and Sh3,000 in the towns. 






According to Mr Simon Kihara, the chairman of Kiambu Property Investment Link Company, which has pitched camp at Njabini, most expressions of interest involve investors who want to put up entertainment joints and residential gated communities. 

“From Gataka-ini all the way to Njabini is the Aberdare Forest and along the way is a fish camp … where investors placing bids are anticipating an opportunity for tourism,” he told the Nation. 

Most bids are in Gatanga Sub-County, where land is available in bigger portions as compared to Njabini township, where the land is already subdivided into plots. 

“In Gatanga, it is very possible to get land in one- and five-acre packages, and once bought and subdivided into plots, the gain for investors hits the roof. Others want land in at least three-acre packages where they can invest in hotels and lounges as well as camp sites,” he said. 

Mombasa hoteliers 

Mr Ngugi said there were bids from three Mombasa hoteliers seeking temporary leases to build tourist hotels at the Aberdare Forest stretch between Gataka-ini and Njabini.

“Other opportunities that we will have are establishment of gas stations, exhibitions to showcase Gatanga musical talent, tour operators capitalising on selling the Ndakaini dam, vast tea plantations and rich culture as tourist attraction opportunities,” he said. 

Area County Commissioner Mohammed Barre said the road is one of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s legacy projects, which must be delivered within schedule and be of high quality. 

“The President is very much concerned that this road be delivered since it has been long overdue in fulfilling the wish of Murang’a and Nyandarua people to get linked,” he said, adding that once complete, the returns should easily reach Sh15 billion annually by 2025. 

The road is expected to open up the region to Machakos, Garissa, Kitui and Nakuru counties. 

Travelling from Gatanga to Njabini will cost Sh80, from the current Sh250. 

As Henan Highway Construction Company earthmovers continue to implement the project, property brokers are all over the place linking buyers to juicy deals. 






Benefits 

Immediate direct benefits include employment of at least 500 youths and about 20 new small businesses, including sale of food and drinks, supply of culverts and investment consultancies being established in the area. Landlords will tap into the market provided by workers engaged in the project.

Mr Ngugi said the project has breathed a new lease of life into dormant towns that are now awash with speculative property investors buying any available space. 

“So good is land business in this area that the multiplying factor by the time the project is delivered in the next 36 months is billed to rise steadily to rest at six times the principal investment. I urge interested land buyers in this area to be very vigilant and apply due diligence since we also know there are crooks,” he said. 

Area Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss John Kanda told the Nation that he has categorised land related crimes as among resultant effects of the huge interest investors have expressed in land in the area. 

“We want to assure all involved that we are working round the clock to ensure that such a high economic value project does not get transformed into a slaughter house for investors through fraudulent land deals. While we urge all to exercise due diligence before committing themselves to deals, we will remain vigilant and round up all crooks,” he said.
