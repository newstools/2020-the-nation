Just like any other frontier town, Moyale is now very busy.A new tarmac stretches past the town into the Moyale part of the Ethiopian side. Moyale town, which borders Ethiopia, was once a trouble hotspot for authorities due to ethnic clashes coupled with sectarian fights and banditry.
The once sleepy border town is inhabited by nomads and for many years, locals did not consider themselves Kenyans for the simple reason that there was little or no government presence in the area.

But not anymore.
An economic transformation has occurred in the last 10 years, and the town is now basking in robust trade.

“We are contented. Business has been good in the recent years and we are optimistic that moving forward, the town will flourish,” said Mr Haro Tajrib, a trader. Today, President Uhuru Kenyatta is set to receive Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Moyale for the opening of the Moyale one-stop border post (OSBP).

The post is expected to increase trade volumes passing through the border point of the two countries as well as enhance security.
Perennial conflicts
The perennial conflicts in the area will be among the two leaders' key talking points in their meetings. The construction of the more than Sh800 million OSBP was completed in 2018. 
The initiative is a multi-agency approach by the Border Management Secretariat, Immigration Department, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), Port Health Services, Border Police Patrol Unit, Kenya Bureau of Standards, the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service, among others.

The Ethiopia-Kenyan border stretches for over 830km and is served by only one official border point in Moyale, resulting in the emergence of several other crossing points.
The Moyale business community is upbeat about the opportunities presenting themselves.
The Chambers of Commerce and Industry Moyale Charter Chairman Ali Muumin said the launch of the OSBP was the reaffirmation of both neighbouring nations to transform the area into a business hub of the Horn of Africa.
“We look forward to having Moyale town transformed into a Dubai of Africa as promised by President Kenyatta five years after it is launched. We also ask our neighbour Ethiopia to fully utilise the OSBP,” Mr Muumin said. 
He said the launch is anticipated to boost the Kenya-Ethiopia trade and relations.
He added that once the post is fully operationalised, it will boost trade volumes between the two nations and seal all the porous border points that encourage illicit trades.
Modern facility 
While commissioning the OSBP in November 2019, National Treasury CS Ukur Yatani called on residents of the Upper Eastern region to take advantage of the post.
He noted that the modern facility was being underutilised.
Then acting CS, who was accompanied by KRA Board of Directors led by Chairman Ambassador Francis Muthaura, KRA commissioners and Interior Ministry officials, said the government was working towards full implementation of an agreement on free trade that was reached earlier between the two countries.

While addressing KRA staff and stakeholders in the region, the CS also promised to establish more one-stop border posts at the Kenya-Ethiopia border to facilitate trade between the two countries and ensure high levels of compliance among traders in the region.
He further directed KRA to be convening regular multi-agency meetings, which should be attended by stakeholders among them community leaders to address issues that would be contributing to the underutilisation of the facility.
The OSBP concept is anticipated to regulate movement by improving border crossing speed and efficiency; hence reducing barriers to trade and improving business competitiveness.
At the OSBPs, KRA has put in place measures such as installation of scanners and intelligence aided verification of cargo to address mis-declarations, concealments, and substandard cargo.
