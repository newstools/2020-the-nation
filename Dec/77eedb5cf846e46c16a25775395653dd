A Kenyatta University student has been arrested for allegedly luring a 15-year-old girl to cohabit with him.
Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) arrested Peter Wanjohi, 20, who has allegedly been living with the minor at his house in Gitambaya, Kiambu County.
According to DCI, his arrest came after the minor’s parents reported her missing a week ago from their home in Kirinyaga County.

“Her distraught parents had received a shocking text message from her that she would be in a holiday camp for a month. Sadly, the school going child had been harboured by one Peter Wanjohi, a 20-year-old Kenyatta University student at his house in Gitambaya, Kiambu County,” DCI said. 
The Ruiru-based detectives said the two were handed over to the reporting station in Kagio for further police action.





“Our detectives are ready to swing into action, should any Kenyan file a missing child’s report or any other such matter that requires our urgent attention.”
Calls to review Act
Legislatures have been calling for a review of the Sexual Offences Act to allow young sex offenders engaging in consensual sex to receive counselling instead of prison terms.
On Sunday, Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui called for the review of the Act after learning that at the Nakuru GK Prison, numerous 20-year-olds are serving long jail terms after being convicted of sexual offences.
“We urge Parliament to review the sexual offences law to ensure that justice prevails for both boys and girls. We should seek to solve a problem holistically and not substituting it with another problem,” said Mr Kinyanjui.
According to the governor, the law largely presumes the male suspect to be guilty until proven innocent. According to the law, those found guilty face a jail term of not less than 15 years.

“Mass incarceration of boys deserving our guidance and protection is unacceptable,” he said.
“It is equally baffling to note that even when both are minors say 16 years, the boy will almost always be in prison while the girl goes scot-free,” added Governor Kinyanjui. The arrests were made after area residents tipped off the police of noise coming from the entertainment joint.
