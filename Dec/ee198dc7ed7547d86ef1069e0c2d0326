Mastering his media savvy, Trump orchestrated a significant shift in the American consciousness.For Trump, even the EU and Nato were objects of disdain. As far as politics goes, Donald Trump literally came from nowhere, and beat establishment figures like Hillary Clinton. Then it went so horribly wrong, both for him as a leader, but also for the country he turned into a laughing stock.
The much-lauded inexperience in matters Washington, first seen as a breath of fresh air, turns out to be his Achilles’ heel. From the outset, when he held up his first executive orders with a triumphant grin, the scene was set for a roller-coaster autocratic and shambolic leadership ride fed by a streak of incurable narcissism.

The man who ran TV shows and casinos that churned out winners was poised to star on the biggest political stage on earth, with the intrigue straight out of Citizen Kane.
Like a rock star, he lapped up the admiration, thrived on the highs that hero-worship engendered, played to the gallery, who in turn forgave his indiscretions, ignored the insults, for their hero could do no wrong.

The chinks in the armour soon started to show. Trump surrounded himself with close family and sycophants. It was one scandal after another, with several close associates ending up in jail.
The shenanigans were reminiscent of a mafia family. The White House was starting to look and sound like some State House in the third world countries Trump had dismissed in unprintable terms.
Celebrities
But, as many celebrities know only too well, the thrill of adulation carries the self-destruct seed in form of that old trait, hubris, which, became increasingly troubling when Trump rode roughshod over science and held political rallies that exposed thousands to Covid-19.
 Then he started to look like a colonial governor presiding over rival tribes, using divide-and-rule tactics to reward friendly states and threaten to penalise those who didn’t toe the line. He expected judges to overturn election results and hand him the presidency as though they owed allegiance to him.

Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Jill Karofsky expressed it best when she castigated one of Trump’s lawyers: “What you want is for us to overturn this election so that your king can stay in power. That is so un-American.” The pathological desire to cling to power is something we tend to associate with dictators in South America, Africa and Asia.
It is entirely within character that having gone missing in action at the height of the pandemic, having treated the threat to health and lives with a cavalier attitude that has seen 300,000 dead, Trump now sits in front of the cameras taking credit for the great scientific achievement of new-fangled vaccines, with not a hint of irony.
Gaining ground
Mastering his media savvy, Trump orchestrated a significant shift in the American consciousness. He successfully tapped into the disaffection that had gradually seeped into the population.
Across Europe, the conservative, right-wing discourse was gaining ground. The UK had turned its back on the EU, trotting out an anti-immigrant, reclaim our sovereignty narrative that split the country right down the middle.

Not to be outdone, Trump seized the moment. His ‘America first’, ‘Make America Great Again’ slogans signalled a change in direction in geopolitics, toward protectionism and an abandonment of its traditional global moral leadership.

America was going to go it alone, dismissing global warming as a hoax, withdrawing from the Paris Accord, the United Nations Human Rights Commission, abandoning the WHO in the middle of the biggest pandemic of our generation.
A complete repudiation of multilateralism and global cooperation. For Trump, even the EU and Nato were objects of disdain. The utterances and actions made the USA something of a loose cannon, which wasn’t helped by the never-ending charade of the president’s twitter feed.
Trump’s base accepted that too many resources and energies had been diverted from home where charity is supposed to begin, by a president they were prepared to believe was foreign-born.
President Obama was perceived as being too keen to engage, to embrace, to sign treaties, to forge partnerships, even to accept the rise of China.
While many Trumpian values will remain, for now, the experiment has come to an end.
