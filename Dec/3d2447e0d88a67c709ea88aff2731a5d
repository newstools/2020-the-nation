The Covid-19 pandemic has shaken up the global socio-economic systems resulting in job losses, low performance, and shut-down, among many other disruptions.
It’s important to underscore the need for innovative leadership, building resilience and disaster recovery planning as well as business continuity management as key elements of any business recovery and continuity.

Organisations are guided by the mandate spelt out by the policies and applicable legal framework, the tools for operations that should be used in scanning the horizon, and anticipating any unexpected disruption that would hurt its performance.
Since ancient times, the world community has witnessed many disasters varying in magnitude and severity. Disruptions to business operations could be any unanticipated happening that would slow down the operations, affect performance, lead to business closure and damage the organisation brand.





Risk assessment
Although some organisations have a contingency plan in place to help in critical situations, a majority do not. Most organisations, however, do an inadequate job of managing reputation and brand in case of disruption.
They focus their time and resources on handling a crisis that has already surfaced. This is not risk management; it is crisis management — a knee-jerk reactive approach, whose purpose is to limit the damage, but once done with this, another crisis strikes and the organisation is in a cat-and-mouse race throughout its operational life.
An optimal contingency plan should consider unforeseen factors, their likelihood of happening and their consequences, if they occur to the performance. It should be tested at predetermined intervals, making improvements when and where necessary.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-2");
});

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {

});

The severity of any disruption can be measured by its consequences, such as bad reputation, sudden drop in share value, losses in shares, no revenue for the company for specific period and in the worst case, no business at all.
A recovery plan is based on thorough business impact analysis and risk assessment. This involves identification, description and documentation of impact and consequences, implementation of actions to ensure continuity of the operations. Disasters may last for a short or long time, but when an organisation is ready for adversity, it survives and thrives.
The recovery plan can be checked for suitability and applicability by evaluating it against the current scenarios, taking other organisations as examples and simulation of disruption events. As a tool for progressive performance, the documentations of the system must be reviewed at regular intervals.
A good contingency plan allows employees to have enough knowledge on what choices to make, what assets to be protected on high priority and which business operation should continue during a crisis. In other words, organisations have a more controlled procedure to help them come out of a crisis.
International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) through its Technical Committee ISO/TC 292, security and resilience, in the year 2019 published a standard ISO 22301: 2019 on security and resilience-Business Continuity Management Systems requirements.

Insecure investment
This standard specifies requirements to implement, maintain and improve a management system to protect against, reduce the likelihood of occurrence of, prepare for, respond to and importantly recover from any disruptions when they arise.
It is applicable to all types and sizes of organizations that; implement, maintain and improve a business continuity management system (BCMS). It seeks to ensure conformity with stated business continuity policy and objectives and continue to deliver products and services at an acceptable pre-defined capacity.
Organizations without a disaster recovery or a business continuity plan are viewed as insecure investment and untrustworthy by customers and stakeholders. Therefore, it is important for any organization to be resilient and implement the ISO 22301: 2019, because disruptions can occur at any time and it is good to be prepared.
Any form of business must make a well-structured plan for disaster recovery and business continuation, even before a catastrophe strikes. Disasters may last for a short or long time, but when an organization is ready for adversity, it survives and thrives.
