Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo has dissolved the Cabinet and ordered all county executives to hand over immediately.
Sources indicate that all the nine executives were shown the door and that one tendered his resignation on Wednesday.
“They received letters terminating their services today (Wednesday). Secretaries in the office of the governor have been sent on leave,” said a source familiar with the changes.

In addition, the county executive’s offices, including that of the governor who took over after John Nyagarama died, have officially been closed for renovation.
County Secretary James Ntabo defended Mr Nyaribo’s decision, saying it is in line with the Constitution.
“If a vacancy arises in the office of the governor, members of the county executive committee cease to hold office,” Mr Ntabo explained, quoting Article 179 (7) of the Constitution.





He clarified that the dissolution of the Cabinet has nothing to do with claims on social media that sackings would follow his takeover.
“He is following the provisions of the law,” he insisted.
Major reforms
Mr Nyaribo assumed leadership on Tuesday following Nyagarama’s death about two weeks ago.
In his inauguration speech, he promised to ruthlessly tackle corruption in the county even as many speakers implored him not to appear to be taking revenge against his critics for the eight years he has served as deputy governor.
Mr Nyaribo also said Nyamira has a bloated wage bill, at 60 per cent of county revenue, which is way above the 35 per cent limit.
"This wage bill is not only irregular but also unsustainable. To address this issue, my government will take appropriate measures aimed at reducing the bill to the required limit as provided for in legislation," said the new governor.

County employees allied to Mr Nyagarama, including executives, had expressed fears that they would be the first victims of Mr Nyaribo's purge of the county administration.
Under-performance
Most of them were conspicuously missing at Mr Nyaribo’s inauguration ceremony, where he also warned employees who have under-performed in the past.
"County staff who are earning huge salaries but are not performing well will not have a place in this government. If they go, we will not pursue them," he said.
Mr Nyaribo and Mr Nyagarama had an on-off relationship since their election in 2013.
On many occasions, Mr Nyaribo differed with his boss over issues including corruption, appointment of staff and general management of the county government.
Residents will be keen to assess his clean-up of the alleged mess as his criticism caused differences between him and the former governor, as well as their supporters.
