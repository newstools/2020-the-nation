Lawyers risk becoming irrelevant if they do not reach the poor and vulnerable, a professor of Law at the University of Nairobi has said.
Prof Patricia Kameri Mbote said there is need to help the poor and vulnerable to access justice.
“Just like the way we talk about the last mile connectivity, as legal fraternity we must also strive to reach the unreached in the last mile of access to justice,” said Prof Kameri on Thursday.

She said that despite Kenya having many skilled lawyers, access to justice for many Kenyans remained mirage because the “attitude of law students and lawyers limit their focus to the rich as they ignore the needy.”
She said the Sustainable Development Goal number 16 seeks to promote the rule of law at national and international levels besides ensuring justice for all.
Access to justice





“Article 48 of our Constitution exhorts the State to ensure access to justice to all persons. It also recognises that access to justice can be hindered by distance and cost and every cost we charge should be minimum and should not impede access to justice,” said Prof Kameri
She observed that access to justice requires many actors to reach the poor.  
“If justice is going to be attained, legal aid must be provided to all,” she said.
She called for improved practical lessons to all law students to prepare them well for the task ahead.   
She observed that universities and other legal education providers have a role to play and appealed to lawyers to give back to the society by facilitating democratic governance, and the rule of law.
 “Legal education must serve the needs of the whole society and not just the rich. Law schools and other legal education providers must integrate legal aid into their curriculum,” said Prof Kameri.

Legal Aid
She was speaking at Sentrim Elementaita Lodge on the role of Law Schools in Legal Aid provision during the National Conference on Legal Aid in Kenya.
The three-day conference whose theme is: “Strengthening access to justice through legal aid” is one of the activities implemented under the Egerton University Faculty of Law Legal Aid Project.
The project is supported by European Union and United Nations Development Programme under Amkeni Wakenya Project within the programme for Legal Empowerment Aid Delivery.
