It is while cooling off from noisy Nairobi when, just a couple of days ago, I met two thoroughly inspiring individuals.
Both of them are aged below 13, but through them I was reminded, once again, of the reason the struggle to grow the women’s game continues so many years after civilisation.

I was on my way to Awendo Green Stadium on Tuesday afternoon when I encountered two little girls, perhaps on their way to collect firewood. They were both barefoot but one of them was wearing a tattered glove on her right hand, and the other was hauling a deflated ball from a short distance.
It made for a lovely scene watching the glove wearer try hard to catch the deflated ball at every instance, diving haphazardly to the right and to the left, obviously imitating someone.





They didn’t stay at their game for too long but as I stood watching them play, I kept wondering: Who was it who sparked the taller girl’s interest in football? Why the particular love for goalkeeping? Whose jersey does she own? Who does she model her game on?
But no dialogue was needed to tell the narrative. Those were ambitious girls with the spirit and ambition to play and succeed in football, but even at age 10, the odds are stacked so high against them that it seems almost foolhardy to expect them to realize their football dreams.
That same evening, I stumbled upon an article on Kahawa Tungu where one Phoebe Ndege had been featured. Phoebe was once a talented and passionate footballer, but she is now now based in the US studying electrical engineering. The tone of the story portrayed Phoebe as a successful former footballer, but I couldn’t help but worry about the thousands of girls countrywide who have had to abandon their football passion in pursuit of alternative success.

While she was still at Sega Girls’ High School, Phoebe captained her school to the national finals of the secondary school games and won a number of personal accolades.
Think of how differently that story could have ended had she been equipped with a clear path of trajectory in her football career. Had she been enrolled in an academy where her skills could be properly nurtured and where she would remain engaged competitively so that she could reach her highest football potential. Perhaps she would now be earning top dollar while playing abroad and representing her country in the best possible way.
Now think of the goalkeeper with one torn glove and how difficult it will be for her to achieve her dreams. For her to even pursue her ambitions. With very few stable league teams and none that have any clear structures of nurturing young talent, our little goalie may never grow to become the next Karen Beardsley.
Watching her stretch in childlike fashion while struggling to catch the ball and flapping her hands funnily in anticipation, all the while laughing heartily with her friend, I found myself longing to see her in real action, standing in goal for self and country, having realized her dreams. I imagine she will grow both in physical stature and presence such that she will make the goal mouth look small.

To do that, however, deliberate efforts must be undertaken to make the climb to the top easier for passionate girls. It won’t be a bad idea for football stakeholders to hold regular talent identification camps in rural areas. That could be where the talent lies.
In happier news, the Royal Morocco Football Federation has rolled out a four-year project worth Sh600 million ($6 million) in an attempt to grow women’s football in Morocco. A minimum wage concept has been introduced whereby clubs will be expected to pay players a minimum of Sh35,000 ($350) in the topflight league and Sh25,000 for the second tier players.
Also, the minimum salary for coaches in the first division will be Sh50,000 ($500) while their counterparts in the second division will earn not less than Sh35,000 ($350).
They have also revived the women’s league governing body (Ligue Nationale de Football Feminin), and have proposed that all clubs set up Under-15 and Under-17 teams which will act as incubators for the national side.
We can only hope that these measures will be implemented to the letter. He served in former president Daniel Moi's cabinet. BBI secretariat cleaned up the 5.2 million signatures that endorsed the Bill, and weeded out 800,000 that had entry irregularities. This comes days after he collapsed at a hotel in Nairobi and was placed under intensive care at Nairobi Hospital.
