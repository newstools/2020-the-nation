The Media Council of Kenya has asked Football Kenya Federation (FKF) president Nick Mwendwa to furnish it with information as to why journalists were barred from covering a Football Kenya Federation Premier League match at the weekend.

"It is important to note that Articles 34 and 35 of the Constitution guarantee media freedom and access to information respectively. Thus the alleged act of denying journalists access to a public event is a violation of their fundamental freedom and rights established under the Constitution. We therefore request that you provide the Council with information on what transpired to shed more light and enable us to resolve the matter," explained Omwoyo.





Owmoyo's letter comes two days after the International Sports Press Associaition (AIPS) criticised FKF's move to block journalists from covering the match.
AIPS president Gianni Merlo said the global sports writers' organisation will defend the independence of journalists, saying this was particularly important during this period of Covid-19 in which journalists are essential in disbursing information.
On Saturday, journalists including Daily Nation duo Silas Kiplagat and Cecil Odongo were denied access to the Nyayo Stadium. FKF has not yet explained why it arrived at the decision to bar these accredited journalists.
Leading media houses including the Nation Media Group and Standard Group have subsequently suspended coverage of FKF leagues and activities in protest.
