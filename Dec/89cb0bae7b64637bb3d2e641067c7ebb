While consumers are less concerned, and probably can’t tell the difference between local and imported sugar – their main concern being affordability and availability – cane growers, processors, researchers and industry analysts have asked one question; when will the sector be ready to compete?Reports indicate newer varieties with a 12-month maturity as opposed to the current 18 months, and a higher percentage of sucrose, at 15 per cent up from the usual 11 per cent have been developed.For the longest time, it has always been reported that the cartels bring in more than the allowable 200 metric tonnes. Players in the sugar industry have received with mixed reaction the extension of the Comesa safeguards by a further two years.
This means Kenya will not open its borders yet for duty-free entry of sugar as the country seeks to position production to a competitive level.

It is emerging that the decades' old economists’ view that the sugar belt of western Kenya is not viable due to environmental factors that mitigate against shorter maturity period and rich sucrose content has been challenged by science.
Reports indicate newer varieties with a 12-month maturity as opposed to the current 18 months, and a higher percentage of sucrose, at 15 per cent up from the usual 11 per cent have been developed.





The new varieties are yet to be introduced to cane farmers, according to an industry insider.
The big question
Another school of thought has it that private players have invested heavily in capacity building and it would be interesting to see this side of things considering rarely do we get good news from the sugar industry.
Sadly, like any other import industry, the sugar business has its owners, the so-called cartels who are always on standby to capitalise on the import window when the government allows duty-free importation of some 200 metric tonnes to plug the deficit in local production. We produce 600 metric tonnes against an 800 metric tonnes requirement.
For the longest time, it has always been reported that the cartels bring in more than the allowable 200 metric tonnes.

Imports are lucrative because local sugar is expensive due to high production costs occasioned by obsolete technology, low sucrose content from cane grown in the western sugar belt and mismanagement of state-owned factories.
The big question is, what will change in 2022 when the Comesa deadline comes? Would Kenya have introduced the new varieties, installed new processing technology and streamlined the factories? Or shall we be negotiating, yet again for further safeguard extensions?
