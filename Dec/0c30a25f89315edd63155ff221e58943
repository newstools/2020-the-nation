Senate convenes special sitting to begin impeachment proceedings against Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. Sonko will need 24 votes on his side to survive his removal from office. The impeachment trial, which was scheduled between last Thursday and Friday, was rescheduled to today. The DP's ally, Feisal Bader, garnered 15,251 votes to trounce ODM’s Omar Boga who secured 10,444 votes in the hotly contested poll. Ministry of Health estimates that the first batch of the recipients will cover 20 per cent of the country’s population.
