Covid-19 super-spreader events have become the norm, and will surely continue into the New Year.Year 2021 is bound to be a political one that diverts us all from the far more urgent tasks of mere survival. We usually approach a new year full of hope and optimism. Even with the ‘annus horribilis’ of 2020, we should be confident that having scraped the bottom, we can only look up to good tidings.
There is little to indicate that 2021 heralds better things. Covid-19 made this a lost year, and even with vaccine promises, there is little to indicate that we are anywhere near to overcoming devastation wrought by the worst global pandemic in over 100 years.

The only proven solution so far to Covid-19 lies in discipline and adherence to the simple preventive measures such as face masks, social distancing, hygiene, avoiding crowded places and close human interactions.
But everywhere we look, we see reckless behaviour in the streets, shopping centres, market places, churches, mosques, political rallies and even family gatherings. Covid-19 super-spreader events have become the norm, and will surely continue into the New Year.





There also seems to be no solution in sight to the economic carnage designed by the Jubilee government. President Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto were elected into office promising an energy and imagination of youth that would deliver a stable, prosperous and united new Kenya.
‘Borrow, spend and steal’ policies
Instead, we have regressed into utter incompetence and mismanagement, destruction of the economy, and unearthing of the atavistic tribal and political rivalries that always act as sparks to electoral conflagration.
Corruption
Corruption has spiralled out of control despite all the rhetoric, and we can be sure that the ‘borrow, spend and steal’ economic policies will continue to impoverish us all.
Then there is the politics. Whether it is the BBI referendum or premature positioning for 2022, it’s criminal to burden Kenyans with mindless duels at a time when Covid-19 and economic collapse are both taking such terrible tolls.

Year 2021 is bound to be a political one that diverts us all from the far more urgent tasks of mere survival. The tragedy is that then when the economic and political elite fight for their slices of Kenya, all the rest of us are drawn into these greedy battles.
The Uhuru-Ruto partnership was not about Kenya but about two incompatible individuals entering a marriage of convenience. It follows that the divorce should not concern us at all, and neither should Mr Kenyatta’s dalliance with opposition chieftain Raila Odinga.
The extent to which we get sucked into selfish political battles is perfectly illustrated by a video in wide circulation featuring former Starehe MP, ‘Bishop Dr’ Margaret Wanjiru, and her bid for the office of Nairobi Governor left vacant with impeachment of the mercurial Mike Mbuvi Sonko.
Like all politicians with problems standing on their own two feet, the prosperity gospel evangelist must seek the crutch of a dominant political player; in this case DP Ruto, who is engaged in a titanic battle against President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga.





She chooses to stake her claim by asserting that the Uhuru-Ruto ‘kumi-kumi’ power transfer pact is binding to all the Kikuyu people. Total and absolute rubbish! If there was such an agreement, it was between two individuals. I was not consulted and I’m not aware of any member of my immediate and extended family who was.

Ethnic chiefs
Save for the usual bunch of self-seeking politicians, mercenary cheering squads and self-appointed community elders for hire, nowhere was there a meeting where the Kikuyu community endorsed the alleged power transfer pact.
And neither were the Kalenjin as a community bound, man, woman and child, to support such a private deal. In any case, political pacts of that nature, whether signed on paper or sealed with illegal oaths, are worthless and not binding even to the beneficiaries, leave alone their communities.
State House does not belong to President Kenyatta, and it is not for him to bequeath it to anyone. Neither does it belong to the extended Kikuyu community, which therefore cannot be bound to such promises.
Finally, the argument which is so prevalent in central Kenya falls flat on its face on a basic principle: If President Kenyatta ever had the mandate to bind the entire Kikuyu nation to a political promise, it follows that he also has the mandate to free the people from the alleged debt.
And he would also have the mandate to bind his people to a new arrangement with Mr Odinga or any other succession contender. Balderdash, I repeat.
As we enter the New Year, the best we can do is free ourselves from the baggage of worthless political promises and mindless loyalty to ethnic chiefs.
