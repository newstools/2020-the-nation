A senior police officer accused of sexually abusing six boys was on Thursday charged with sodomy.
The Officer Commanding Station (OCS), Mr John Kimathi Marete, was taken to court under tight police security and taken straight to the dock to answer to the charges.
He has since been interdicted for allegedly committing the sexual offences.

When he appeared before the Senior Resident Magistrate, Mr Tony Kwambai, he pleaded not guilty to six charges of sodomy and exposing the boys to pornography.
He denied that between 2017 and 2020 in Chogoria Sub-Location in Tharaka Nithi County, he sodomised the boys aged between 12 and 16 years.
He was also accused of intentionally and unlawfully exposing three of the boys to pornographic audio-visuals on December 21 this year.
The former Ntumu police station OCS in Mara Sub-County urged the court to release him on bond so that he could be attending court from his home.





He argued that the charges he faced were bailable and there was no need for him to continue being confined in police cells.
Mr Marete promised to be attending court and adhere to all conditions set by the court without fail if freed on bond.
However, the prosecution opposed the bail application, saying the accused was an influential person and he could easily interfere with investigations if released.
The prosecution also said more victims were being sought and more charges could be preferred against the officer.
In his ruling, the magistrate ordered the OCS locked up until January 15 next year when he will renew his bail application.
