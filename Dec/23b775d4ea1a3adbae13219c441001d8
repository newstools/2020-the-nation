The current situation is, as in Jesus’ days, where Roman Caesars or Kings demanded steep taxes beyond what ordinary mwananchi could bear.This Christmas, and as we move towards 2021, let us think ahead as a nation on how to raise our GDP. Never has a more unique Christmas than this been experienced, with the economy reported to be at its worst amid a global pandemic. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics indicates that Kenya’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fell by 5.7 per cent between January and March, compared to a growth of 4.9 per cent in the same period last year, in which an overall expansion of 5.3 per cent was marked. That poverty is biting is not in doubt.

It’s a time no different than the days of Jesus Christ, whose birth Christians are celebrating. Born in a manger, where cows, smelly sheep and other livestock dwell, resources were difficult to come by. Jesus, a carpenter’s son, born in such paucity, regularly spoke of poverty in sayings such as: “The poor you shall always have with you.”
Not surprisingly, most widely held and understood definition of absolute poverty is measured strictly in economic terms. Arguably, if the average Kenyan earns less than $1.9 a day, approximately Sh211, then paradoxically, poverty fits the bill. This amounts to approximately Sh6,330 a month. It is deplorable to imagine a chief income earner expected to feed his or her family with such earnings.





Kenya and Singapore
The Christmas story marked with penury and sheer squalor holds relevance in our times. That Jesus’ parents could not afford a hospital birth or a nice facility is shameful and speaks of the abject poverty experienced in that day. It’s sad to think that many Kenyan families will go without a decent meal this Christmas, a narrative requiring turnaround.
Economists often compare Kenya and Singapore as they both attained independence in 1963. Research Journal of Finance and Accounting, comparing Singapore and Kenya, records: “Ironically Singapore is an emerging third world economy with its GDP over seven times the Kenyan GDP”. As per this 2011 statistic, Singapore’s GDP was estimated at over Sh20 trillion and Kenya’s at Sh2.8 trillion. Unlike Singapore, Kenya is still characterised by high rates of unemployment, poverty, poor housing and healthcare and low life expectancy.

The current situation is, as in Jesus’ days, where Roman Caesars or Kings demanded steep taxes beyond what ordinary mwananchi could bear. The difference with Jesus’ earthly dad being a carpenter, was perhaps in earning a “salary” that sustained his family, as we hear not of impoverishment or deterioration, in Christ’s upbringing. We also know from Holy writings, that Jesus had other siblings born after him and thus he was part of a sizeable family.
The point: Families will continue to grow! But unlike our former peer Singapore with a GDP that allows for the healthcare and pension needs of their population to be met, we cannot guarantee the same to our people.
The story from a wise chap, King Solomon, through whose lineage Jesus was born, provides the answer to poverty: “Money is the answer to all things.” Ecclesiastes 10:19 Think of it. To get treatment in hospital, participate in politics, run a business and educate children, money is key.
This Christmas, and as we move towards 2021, let us think ahead as a nation on how to raise our GDP. When Kenya shines, we all shine. Being dubbed poor; unable to sustain our own is not a compliment.

When relevant stakeholders on food security, pension, saving schemes and others stand up to be counted for the poorest of poor, those earning only Sh211 daily, then we can begin to call ourselves a true lower-middle level economy.

Basic needs
While many travel up-country amidst hiked fares in a strained economy, this too, is bothersome. Will there be merry making or murmuring? Will there be enough for example to eat? While an old and thorny matter, no one ever desires to be poor.
The change in mindset for Jesus’ followers has been profoundly substituted with understanding of economic principle: to seek first God’s Kingdom and all these things — basic needs — will be met. So, while troubles face countless, faceless Kenyans, the Christmas story ends in resurrection, thus holding out hope.
Love cured all because it selflessly gave the Christmas child up for crucifixion. Love cares. Love shares. I pen a note of wishing you a blessed Christmas with a reminder of the entrepreneur, Muhammad Yunus’ words: “Poverty does not belong in civilised human society. Its proper place is in a museum.”
