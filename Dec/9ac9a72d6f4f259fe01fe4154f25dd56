Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi wants to stamp his authority as region’s kingpin.Jubilee won 12 National Assembly seats in a region widely believed to be under the thumbs of Mr Odinga, Mr Mudavadi Mr Wetang’ula. The impending mini-polls in Matungu and Kabuchai have opened a new front in the battle for the former Western province and its 2.2 million votes as the 2022 General Election approaches.   

The Raila Odinga-led Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) sees Western as its base, with the party boasting of governors in Kakamega, Vihiga and Busia counties.

Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi wants to stamp his authority as region’s kingpin. 

Similarly, Ford-Kenya boss Moses Wetang’ula will be seeking to prove his mettle as a heavyweight by defending the Kabuchai seat that fell vacant following the death of Mr James Lusweti. 

However, Deputy President William Ruto is leaving nothing to chance, visiting the region countless times. 

The by-elections to replace Mr Justus Murunga in Matungu, Kakamega County, and Mr Lusweti in Bungoma present a chance for the three men to square it out in contests many see as launching pads for 2022. 






Dr Ruto’s allies in Kakamega – including former Senator Boni Khalwale, Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali and Malava MP Malulu Injendi – have vowed to wrestle the Matungu seat from ANC. 

Buoyed by the Msambweni by-election where Dr Ruto-backed independent candidate Feisal Bader beat ODM’s Omar Boga, the DP’s allies have warned their opponents of a similar feat in Kabuchai and Matungu constituencies. 

“We will talk to voters in Matungu and listen to them before settling on a candidate who will be ready to work with Dr Ruto the way Mr Murunga did. We are confident our candidate will emerge victorious,” the Mumias East lawmaker said.

Ruto brigade 

Dr Khalwale said the Ruto brigade is determined to win the seat. 

“Mudavadi should prepare for a major battle. We will continue popularising Dr Ruto’s presidential bid,” he said. 

Western is important for Dr Ruto, Mr Odinga and Mr Mudavadi, going by the 2017 elections results. 

Jubilee won 12 National Assembly seats in a region widely believed to be under the thumbs of Mr Odinga, Mr Mudavadi Mr Wetang’ula. 

While President Kenyatta garnered a paltry 66,000 votes from the four Western counties in 2013, the figure rose to 242,000 three years ago, a number Dr Ruto expects to surpass. 

With 743,736 voters in Kakamega, 272,409 in Vihiga, 559,850 in Bungoma, 351,048 in Busia and 339,622 in Trans Nzoia, the battle for the Western bloc carries with it the numbers. 

In an area that did not have a Jubilee MP in the 2013-2017 Parliament, the ruling party won four of the 12 MP seats in Kakamega county – Ikolomani, Malava, Navakholo and Mumias East. Dr Ruto has since won over Dr Khalwale. 

Due to his closeness to Dr Ruto, Mr Washiali was dismissed from his National Assembly Minority Whip post, which was snapped by Navakholo’s Emmanuel Wangwe. 

Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya deputises Mr Odinga as ODM leader.

ANC has already identified one of the hopefuls, Peter Nabulindo, as its candidate in the March 4 Matungu by-election. 

Primaries 

ODM and Mr Kenyatta’s Jubilee have invited interested aspirants to run ahead of the primaries that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission says must take place before the end of next month. 






Yesterday, Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala, who was accompanied by several MPs, said ANC has settled on Mr Nabulindo as its candidate. 

“We have consulted widely and decided with the blessing of Mr Mudavadi to have Mr Nabulindo as our flag-bearer. We have already made arrangements to issue him a nomination certificate on tomorrow,” the senator said. 

In the 2017 elections, Mr Nabulindo contested on a Ford Kenya ticket and came second with 10,636 votes against Mr Murunga’s 18,088. 

Mr David Were of ODM, who was the sitting MP, was third with 8,618 votes. 

Mr Malala was accompanied by Lugari MP Ayub Savula, Mr John Sakwa Bunyasi (Nambale), Mr Titus Khamala (Lurambi), Mr Alfred Agoi (Sabatia) and Mr Oku Kaunya (Teso North). 

Mr Savula said the Matungu by-election would be an important test for Mr Mudavadi’s 2022 bid.
