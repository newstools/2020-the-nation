Former Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders chairman Paul M'Ethingia has died after a short illness.
According to the family, the 81-year-old elder died on Saturday after developing blood sugar complications the previous day.
"He was rushed to hospital but passed on on Jamhuri Day while the condition was being managed. He has been healthy and going on with his business. Burial arrangements are ongoing," his son Isaac Mutuma said.

Several leaders eulogised Mr M'Ethingia as a wise elder who pursued peace and helped secure the future of Njuri Ncheke by allowing professionals to be initiated into the group.
National Council of Elders Chairman Phares Rutere, who is a former Njuri Ncheke secretary-general, said Mr M'Ethingia took over as chairman in 1987.
M'Ethingia was the fifth chairman after paramount chief M'Angaine M'Ithiiria, chief M'Ikiugu Gathinya, senior chief M'Anampiu Kaigwara and paramount chief Naaman Mwirichia.

Very articulate
"We have lost an elder who was very articulate on Njuri Ncheke affairs. He taught many of us the rich ideologies of Njuri Ncheke and was committed to the welfare of the Ameru. He was behind the inclusion of professionals in the council which has enabled continuity of Njuri Ncheke in a fast-evolving world," Mr Rutere said.
Njuri Ncheke Operations Secretary-General Mbaya Muthamia said Mr M'Ethingia was an articulate elder who fought against female genital mutilation and helped in the resolution of many land disputes.
Mr Josrphat Murangiri, the secretary-general in charge of programmes, said they intend to give M'Ethingia a state burial for his role in promoting the Ameru culture.
M'Ethingia was among a group of elders who backed former Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi's dream of a United States of Africa.

"M'Ethingia was not only passionate about the unity of Ameru but also Kenya and Africa. We travelled with him several times to Libya and Nigeria in the bid to have a united Africa," Mr Rutere said.
M'Ethingia will also be remembered for slapping prominent Meru politicians, including Governor Kiraitu Murungi and former Finance minister David Mwiraria, with hefty fines for going against the ideals of Njuri Ncheke.
It was during his tenure that Njuri Ncheke asked former president Mwai Kibaki to pay a goat after former First Lady Lucy Kibaki allegedly slapped former Imenti Central MP Gitobu Imanyara.
M'Ethingia handed over the leadership mantle to Mr Linus Kathera in December last year after four years of wrangling that created two factions of Njuri Ncheke.
The two factions entered an out-of-court settlement in April 2019, leading to a unity pact where leaders from both factions were given positions in an expanded leadership of the Supreme Council of Njuri Ncheke.
