A woman in Voi, Taita Taveta County, allegedly cut her nephewâ€™s genitals when he went to her home after a drinking spree and demanded to spend the night there.
Police said the incident occurred on Friday night at Ndarunyi village in Mbololo.
They said the 29-year-old man irked his aunt when he inserted his genitals in a hole in the door, so she decided to teach him a lesson.

Voi Sub-county Police Commander Bernstein Shari said the man was stable.
"We are waiting for the suspect to get better and fill the P3 form in order for us to arrest the suspect and charge her," Mr Shari said.
