One person died and five others were seriously injured on Thursday when a matatu collided with a lorry in Gatunduri Village in Embu County.
Survivors suffered leg and hand fractures and were taken to the Embu Referral Hospital.
The lorry was heading to Embu from Meru when the collision occurred. The matatu was from the opposite direction. One passenger died on the spot.

According to witnesses, the lorry was overtaking another vehicle when the collision occurred.
The accident caused a major traffic jam along the busy Embu-Meru highway as residents and police blocked the road to rescue passengers from the mangled matatu.
"I saw the lorry overtaking another vehicle before it ploughed into the matatu," a witness, Mr Patrick Mureithi, said.
Immediately after the accident, the lorry driver fled, leaving the matatu survivors groaning in pain.





Embu West police boss Charles Kinyua said the driver of the lorry was responsible for the accident and he was being sought.
"We are looking for the driver so that he can be prosecuted," he said.
Mr Kinyua said the driver will be charged with causing death by careless driving.
"The lorry driver knew he was in the wrong and that is why he fled but we are tracking him down," he said. Nakuru county government says bodies are congesting mortuaries.
