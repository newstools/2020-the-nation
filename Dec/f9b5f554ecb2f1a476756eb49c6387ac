Parents’ role of inculcating proper moral and ethical behaviour in their children cannot be gainsaidParents cannot shirk from their responsibilities and dump children in school for teachers to mould into responsible citizens. The ‘work-from-home’ directive meant to curb the spread of Covid-19 brought an uneasy closeness between family members who had virtually been living apart due to modern lifestyles.
 It has been pointed out that the change from the traditional unit, where families spend most of their time together, to the modern lifestyle, where children attend boarding school and parents work in towns, has resulted in disjointed relationships.

In some cases, the children are closer to the househelps and at times even refer to them as their “mums”. Meanwhile the real “mums” have become familiar strangers to their children, who hardly find quality time for bonding.
Parents’ role of inculcating proper moral and ethical behaviour in their children cannot be gainsaid. A lifestyle where children and their parents live together as familiar strangers is setting a dangerous precedent that could have far-reaching repercussions.

When we were growing up, discipline was a shared community responsibility and any villager could ‘punish you’ if they caught you misbehaving.
Corporal punishment
However, things have changed drastically and child rights activism has stolen the thunder from parenting. Children dictate terms and parents have to oblige. This liberalism has contributed to rising cases of indiscipline in our learning institutions, largely because some students want to enjoy the same freedom and leeway they get at home back in school.
 In fact, the abolishment of corporal punishment in schools has added to the challenges facing teachers as they struggle to correct bad behaviour that children import to school due to poor parenting.
On the one hand, imparting discipline in learners should be viewed as a multipronged issue, where several approaches should be applied depending on the nature of the cases at hand.

});
}, 62000);
}



Corporal punishment
Where counselling fails other approaches such as corporal punishment should be exacted, given that there are students who cannot reform unless the cane is applied.
 On the other hand, it has been a salutary lesson for parents during the corona break after realising the tough challenge of containing their children at home and imparting discipline to the restless youths.
I am sure by now they have realised and appreciated the fact that teachers go through a lot of difficulties performing the roles of both teachers and parents at the same time.
Responsible citizens
However, parents cannot shirk from their responsibilities and dump children in school for teachers to mould into responsible citizens.
School years are measured and after a certain period, the students will either come back home to live with their parents or join the outside world.
Depending on whether one was disciplined in school or otherwise, the world out there will deal with them accordingly.
Whichever way, parents cannot run away from shouldering the responsibility of ensuring that their children are moulded into role models for future generations.
