The Contract for the Construction of Makupa dual carriage Bridge was awarded by Kenha Director General Peter Mundinia to China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC) in November 2020.
The Makupa Causeway was built by the British colonial government in 1929 and is one of the links between Mombasa Island and the mainland, serving as the main road transport link between Mombasa Island and the Kenyan hinterland.





Speaking to residents of the area and project staff, President Kenyatta reiterated the Government's commitment to continue rolling out transformative development projects across the country.
Three road links
When complete in January 2022, the four-lane over-sea bridge, pave the way for its demolition and restoration of the ecosystem in the area; including free flow of water and marine life according to a statement from the State House’s twitter handle.

The causeway currently separates the waters that surround Mombasa Island into Tudor Creek to the East and Port Reitz Creek to the west, hindering the free movement of water and marine life and decaying ecosystem. Residents of Mombasa have been eagerly waiting the commissioning of the bridge. The bridge is expected to help deal with at least 50 percent of pedestrian congestion at the Likoni channel.
