As the country ushers in the New Year, a majority of Kenyans want the government to address the rising cases of unemployment, the high cost of living, as well as lack of access to better healthcare.
A research conducted by polling firm Infotrak and whose results were released on Thursday shows that a majority of Kenyans – about 61 per cent – believe that 2020 was an extremely difficult year, mainly because of the Covid-19 pandemic and mismanagement of the economy.

}



Those surveyed said that corruption, the Covid-19 pandemic, lack of access to better education and the crisis in the healthcare sector, including the strike by healthcare workers, were some of the causes of the difficulties experienced in 2020. The survey was conducted between December 27 and 29 with a margin of error of a plus/minus 3.

});
}, 62000);
}



The respondents also listed lack of access to basic amenities like water during the pandemic, lack of food, insecurity and crime, high cost of doing business, the crisis in the education sector, among other things, as some of the issues that contributed to the hardships experienced in 2020.
“Unemployment, the high cost of living and access to healthcare are the issues that concern Kenyans most at the moment,” said Mr Walter Nyabundi, director of research at Infotrak.

 “Unemployment ranked at 18 per cent, high cost of living at 13 per cent, access to healthcare at 10 per cent, corruption at 7 per cent, the Covid-19 pandemic at 6 per cent, quality of education at 5 per cent,” he added.
A further analysis of the data, according to Mr Nyabundi, revealed that a majority of the difficulties experienced by most Kenyans were tied to loss of jobs, resulting from layoffs by companies during the pandemic, closure of businesses and the decline in the growth of the economy, which meant less money in the pockets of Kenyans.

The result of this is that most people either forfeited what they had previously considered as necessities but which they could no longer afford like holidays during the festive season and even family get-togethers and celebrations.
Of those surveyed, in all the eight regions across the country, celebrations like Christmas were no longer a priority, with most respondents worried about the possibilities of either regaining their businesses and jobs or the potential of the economy bouncing back in the new year.
The report shows that 44 per cent of the surveyed respondents stated that financial instability was the biggest reason for the difficulties experienced in 2020, while another 45 per cent either lost their jobs or saw their businesses collapse.
Another 2 per cent said they had lost a friend or relative to Covid-19, with another 1 per cent contracting the virus. Another 1 per cent of the respondents admitted that they had been evicted from their homes while another 1 per cent reported to have had a family member contracting the virus.

});
}, 62000);
}



“On celebrating the festive period, 77 per cent have been unable to spend this festive period as they have in the past, 61 per cent have been unable to celebrate this festive period as they would have liked due to the financial constraints,” said the report.

Looking forward to 2021, 61 per cent believe that the new year will be a better year than the previous one, with some 27 per cent of the respondents hopeful that the economy will improve while another 15 per cent are looking forward to receiving vaccinations against Covid-19.
“The findings were that overall, 38 per cent were very optimistic, 23 per cent somewhat optimistic, 30 per cent averagely optimistic, while 6 per cent were not optimistic and another 3 per cent not at all optimistic,” said Mr Nyabundi.
Of those optimistic, 27 per cent were hopeful that the economy will improve, 15 per cent that Kenyans will receive the vaccine against Covid-19, 14 per cent that their finances will improve, 10 per cent that they will get a job, while 9 per cent were optimistic that their businesses will expand.
Some 9 per cent are of the feeling that the upcoming referendum will divide the country while another 8 per cent believe that there will be an increase in ethnic tensions and rivalry.
