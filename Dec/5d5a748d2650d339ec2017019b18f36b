When MCAs accuse governors of mismanaging funds, being corrupt and inept, it’s just a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Since the Constitution was promulgated in 2010 and devolution came into force, county government leadership has witnessed many challenges, key among them the election of governors and their impeachment.
Granted, devolution is a relatively new concept and leaders may not measure up to the tasks bestowed upon them, but what we have witnessed in some counties is nothing short of infamy. However, it’s common knowledge that governors and ward reps have a love/hate relationship.

Governors have always lamented being blackmailed by MCAs and those who refuse to succumb to their demands are threatened with impeachment.
 Probably what needs to be interrogated seriously is the impeachment process so that governors do not fall victims of MCAs’ avarice. It is true that not all governors are competent, but the people bestowed with the powers to oust them are not any better.





Influenced by outsiders
When MCAs accuse governors of mismanaging funds, being corrupt and inept, it’s just a case of the pot calling the kettle black. The cases of Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru, Kiambu’s Ferdinand Waititu and Nairobi’s Mike Sonko were well highlighted.
What should elicit concern is not if the governors in question were guilty of the charges brought before them or not. Rather, it’s the realisation that the process has always been under undue influence by outside powers.
It’s miscarriage of justice when a judicial process is prone to abuse and manipulation. Take the issue of former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, for instance. A group of MCAs allied to him admitted having gone into hiding at the Coast so that they could not participate in the voting process. Shirking from a key responsibility such as voting to impeach a governor is gross misconduct and the law should clearly spell out the punishment to be meted on such leaders.

No wonder the MCAs have turned their positions into cash cows so that every time the chips are down, they bring up all sorts of accusations to blackmail governors so that their selfish demands can be met.
This issue needs to be addressed clearly in future legislations so that errant MCAs are shown the door as fast as the governors are being impeached.
