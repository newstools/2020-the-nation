Football pundits accuse foreign tacticians of using top teams to better their CVs  High turnover of coaches marks Covid-19 ravaged Premier League season Football was one of the sports that was heavily affected this year by the deadly coronavirus. 

Three days after the first case of Covid-19 was reported in the country on March 12, the government halted all sporting activities to help combat the spread of the virus. 

In April, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) President Nick Mwendwa, in a tweet, cancelled the 2019/20 Kenyan Premier League (KPL) season and declared Gor Mahia the champions. An average of 23 league games had been played.

A number of coaches in the KPL found the going rough, and were fired over poor performance. Some foreign coaches tendered their resignation, some because of dire straits but others quit under a cloud of suspicion. 

Football pundits think foreigners have been using Kenyan teams, mainly 19-time league champions and their sworn rivals, AFC Leopards to better their curriculum vitae before looking for jobs in other top clubs on the African continent.

}




Gor, Wazito, Leopards, Sofapaka, Bandari and Nzoia Sugar are some of the KPL sides which hired and fired coaches at will. 

Of all the top-flight clubs, Wazito who are into their second season in the top flight, had the highest turnover of coaches last season. 

The club that is currently coached by former Harambee Stars tactician, Francis Kimanzi, dismissed coaches six times. They are Fred Ambani, British coach Stewart Hall, Harambee Stars Under-20 coach Stanley Okumbi, Fred Ouna, youthful tactician Hamisi Abdalla and Egyptian-American Melis Medo. 

Players axed 

The axe not only fell on the tacticians but also on the players who were deemed surplus the squad. 

Among the players shown the door in July controversially included Victor Ndinya, Teddy Osok, Derrick Otanga, goalkeeper Steve Njung’e, Kevin Omondi, Augustine Otu, Piscas Kirenge, Issioffu Bourahana and Paul Acquah.

});

Through his Twitter account, the club’s tough-talking owner, Swedish tycoon Ricardo Badoer came under fire for referring to the players as “hyenas” due to bad performance. 

He claimed that the sacking of the players was a cleaning process, since “most of them were signed behind his back”. 

“K’Ogalo” were not left behind. British tactician Steven Polack, 59, left the club under unclear circumstances after being at the helm for 13 months.

He resigned in September while on a 10-day holiday in the United Kingdom. 

The Briton joined a growing list of Gor coaches who “go on holidays” in their homeland but never to return. Polack became the fourth Gor coach to leave the club in such manner. 

Before him, were Dylan Kerr, Turkish-Cypriot Hassan Oktay, and Brazilian Jose Marcelo Ferreira aka Ze Maria. 

Polack had a colourful stay at Gor, he won the Sports Journalist Association of Kenya (SJAK) Coach for the Month of September/October in 2019 and in February 2020. 

This month, another Gor Mahia coach Brazilian Roberto Oliveira, Polack’s successor, quit.  

The 60-year-old Brazilian tactician, 60, never oversaw any competitive match for Gor because he lacked the requisite coaching credentials.

});
}, 62000);
}




He left the country for Brazil on December 17 to upgrade his coaching papers. In the mean time, Gor are looking for another coach.

The African football governing body, Caf, wrote to FKF and Gor on November 21, notifying them that the former Brazilian international player didn’t have a Caf “A” coaching licence or Uefa Pro, its equivalent, and therefore he was not eligible to oversee “K’Ogalo’s” continental assignment. 

'Unsafe in the country' 

AFC Leopards were not short of drama either. Their new coach, Tomas Trucha, resigned just a month into his job citing threats to his agent. The Czech said he felt unsafe in the country.

Trucha, who previously handled Botswana’s Township Rollers, was in charge of just one game for Ingwe which bagged a 2-1 win against Tusker Football Club in the opening week of 2020/21 Premier League campaign. 

The 40-year-old has since landed a new job in Malaysia. Leopards are now being managed by their former player and Kenyan international Anthony “Modo” Kimani, assisted by Tom Juma. 

Last season, Bandari were the first to axe their coach, Bernard Mwalala, just 13 days into the New Year after a string of poor results in the league. 

After Mwalala’s dismissal, the club turned to former Harambee Stars coach Twahir Muhiddin to hold the position in an acting capacity. Bandari management reappointed Ken Odhiambo who had left the club in 2018 for further studies in South Sudan.

During his two-year stint at Bandari,  Mwalala won the Betway Shield, catapulting the Dockers to the continental competitions after four years in the cold. Bandari also finished second twice and won silver in the Super Cup. 

In November last year, Bandari were eliminated from the Caf Confederation Cup at the play-offs stage by Horoya FC of Guinea in a two-legged contest. They fell 1-0 to the Guinea heavyweights at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani after being beaten 4-2 away in the first leg. 

The 2009 league champions Sofapaka sacked coach John Baraza early this month. 

Sofapaka President Elly Kelekwa denied that he was sacked, saying that the former Kenyan international was asked to step aside. 






 "We have asked coach Baraza to step aside as we plan to take him for further studies either in Norway or Germany. For now, Mururi (Mike) is in charge of the team as we prepare for our next match," said Kalekwa. 

Baraza was appointed in December last year after serving as a stand-in coach thrice but his decade-long stay at the club both as a player and a member of the technical bench ended after two losses suffered in the opening three matches of the new season. 

After his departure, Kalekwa said his assistant and former Kenyan international, Mururi, will take over in an acting capacity.

On March 9, Bungoma-based Nzoia Sugar sacked coach Collins “Korea” Omondi due to a string of poor results in the league. 

Nzoia President Evans Kadenge said the decision was taken after the team threw away a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 to Kakamega Homeboyz at Bukhungu Stadium. He was replaced by Sylvester Mulukurwa and goal keeper trainer Peter Mwaura.
