Reduction in the size of farm holdings and the realisation that rabbit meat is highly nutritious are key factors that have promoted rabbit farming.The legalisation of urban farming has also contributed to increased rabbit farming. Rabbits require very little space due to their small size and good social character.In addition to occupying a small fraction of the space occupied by other livestock, rabbits can be housed in stacked up hutches that may be fixed or movable. Unlike chickens, rabbits are less fragile to diseases. The Ministry of Agriculture rates rabbit farming as the fastest growing livestock production activity.
It is estimated that there are over a million rabbits in the country mainly kept as pets, commercial and research animals.

People have also known that white rabbit meat is low in cholesterol content. It, therefore, appeals to the health-conscious segment of meat consumers.
The legalisation of urban farming has also contributed to increased rabbit farming. Rabbits require very little space due to their small size and good social character.
It is rare to find rabbits fighting each other over food, water or space. They nonetheless do fight for mates.
In addition to occupying a small fraction of the space occupied by other livestock, rabbits can be housed in stacked up hutches that may be fixed or movable. Unlike chickens, rabbits are less fragile to diseases.

Rabbits are very small in comparison to other livestock mammals. I refer to them as the miniature livestock.
The biggest challenge with tiny animals is that they tend to eat a lot, pass a lot of faeces and urine.
Consequently, they have a lot of demand for the maintenance of cleanliness and hygiene of their production units. Many farmers miss this aspect of rabbit production and end up paying dearly.
Good hygiene
I visited a farmer in Nairobi two weeks ago who said her rabbits kept getting sick and dying. The compound was saturated with rabbit smell.
She was concerned neighbours would start complaining. “Is it possible to keep rabbits without the smell?” she inquired.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-2");

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



As I entered the compound, I picked the smell from the gate. The rabbit house was well-built with timber, wire mesh and iron sheets. There were about 50 rabbits of different ages.
They were of mixed breed but predominantly New Zealand White. They were fed high-quality commercial feed.
Though the animals were supposed to be mainly white-coated, many of them had discoloured coats. I attributed this to dirtying from the bedding.
I noted the rabbits slept and urinated in the same place. The litter was not frequently changed and some was rotting. The state of the rabbit house explained most of the problems on the farm.
You see, in any animal setup, including humans, good hygiene is extremely important in maintaining health. It keeps stress, injuries and diseases at bay.
I was informed most of the rabbits the farm had lost were found dead without having shown signs of disease.
Others would sneeze, have heavy nasal mucous discharge and then die. I noticed some of the rabbits had red weeping eyes.
Others had inflamed hind legs and matting of the fur on the legs. In general, the rabbits looked stressed and in poor body condition.
Poor level of cleanliness and hygiene
I explained to Mary, the owner, that her main problem was the poor level of cleanliness and hygiene. The house design was fairly good but the management needed to be greatly improved.

}



The rabbit odour emanated from the accumulation of rotting rabbit excreta and urine. It was further complicated by bacteria that broke down the urine to ammonia.
The ammonia caused irritation to the rabbits’ eyes and respiratory tract. This caused tearing, sneezing, coughing and infection.
The sudden deaths were most likely caused by sudden-onset pneumonia arising from stress and chemical injury by inhaled ammonia.
I diagnosed urine burns in the rabbits with inflamed hind legs. This occurs due to constant exposure to fresh and decomposing urine and ammonia. If left unattended, urine burn provides an opportunity for bacterial infection.
With the state of affairs in Mary’s rabbit house, she would never have healthy thriving animals. I treated the rabbits that had an infection with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory injections.
Dirty housing 
I advised Mary to remove all the litter in the rabbit hutches, clean them thoroughly with water and soap and then disinfect the floors.
She would also improve the house by installing a urine drainage system for each hutch.
Before leaving, I summarised to Mary the basis of ensuring good health for her rabbits. She should ensure good nutrition by continuing with high-quality commercial feed.

});

Plant matter of high quality and nutrition could also replace the commercial feed. Clean drinking water should be provided at all times for the rabbits to drink at will.
The living environment should be clean, hygienic, dry and well-ventilated. Rabbits should not be overcrowded.
Finally, I informed Mary that dirty housing produces strong rabbit odour that taints the rabbit meat and makes it unpalatable and unsuitable for the market.
