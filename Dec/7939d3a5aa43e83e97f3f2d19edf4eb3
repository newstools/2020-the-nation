Smile is written all over her face. The smile is backed by hope. Peninah Kitsao had "cooked" stone in the guise of food.
When we visited Ms Kitsao, she was moving into a newly-built six-bedroom house in Mtwapa, Kilifi County, courtesy of well-wishers.
As she carried her household items into the new house, that cost Sh1.4 million, Ms Kitsao could not hide her joy.

"I am happy. I can't explain it enough. I thank Kenyans for their support. I am happy to have this place where I can warmly welcome people. I thank God for how far He has brought me," said Ms Kitsao.
She added: "I thank God as the stones (I boiled) have turned to a house. My children are now having their daily meals just like other children."
The new house that was built following contributions by well-wishers, she says, gives her hope that she will never go back to where she was and will forget what she underwent.





Nothing to eat
Eight months ago, Ms Kitsao, a widow and a mother of eight, had been forced to boil stones in the name of cooking to make her hungry children think that a meal was being prepared as she had nothing to feed them on.
“I had nothing to feed my children on and so I decided to put the stones in the sufuria and boil them so that my children would think that I was cooking something for them,” said Ms Kitsao, a resident of Mleji Village in Milango Saba, when she spoke to the Nation back then.
Ms Kitsao had seen suffering following the Covid-19 threat that is wreaking havoc among hundreds of Kenyans and left many fighting for their survival.
Following the highlight of her plight by the media, hundreds of well-wishers came to her rescue to contribute food and money that sustained her and her children.

Small business 
Part of the contributions, she says, was used to open a small business that she is currently running to fend for her family.
Ms Kitsao lost her husband in 2019 after he was attacked by criminal gangs in Kisauni Sub-county in Mombasa.
She also lost her last born in May this year, a week after she had received aid to save her children from starvation.
Her four-month-old baby, Mary Kaingu, died after having a fever for three days, she said.
To have a stable life, now Ms Kitsao says she will, together with her children, occupy three bedrooms in the new house which has a toilet and is connected to electricity.
The three other rooms, she says, will be rented out to allow her to have an income that she will use to take care of her seven children.
