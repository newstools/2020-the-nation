KeNHA  scored highest at 81 per cent for maintaining 13,344km of the targeted 16,580km of its road networks using the KRB fund distributes.The KeNHA was allocated the highest at Sh23.6 billion from the fund due to its lengthy networks of roads under its watch. The Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA) was ranked poorest among the road agencies in the utilisation of the funds milked from motorists for road maintenance.
The Kenya Roads Board reports on the use of the fund motorists contribute to help keep roads in good condition shows that the rural roads agency had only achieved 28 per cent of the planned maintained works for the period to June 2020.

“By the end of the reporting period, KeRRA had budgeted to maintain 28,837 kilometres of roads but had managed to maintain 8,063 kilometres or 28 per cent of the target,” read the report by the road’s regulator.
The score is much lower than other agencies including the Kenya Urban Roads Authority, which had set out to maintain some 1,796km of roads but maintained 1,170km or 65 per cent of the target over the same period.

KeRRA funds
The KeRRA funds are spent in collaboration with constituency development committees where MPs have significant influence, a key setback for the agency, according to Kenya Roads Board (KRB) insiders.
A senior manager at the road’s regulator, who did not want his identity revealed for fear of fightback from legislators, said the agency’s performance would remain poor as long as MPs still have a say on how they spend road maintenance cash.
“They have a lot of problems even bidding for roads since MPs push for who to be awarded and which roads should be maintained. They end up spreading the funds so thin that they only manage to murram most of the roads which are quickly damaged every rainy season,” the source intimated.
Road networks
The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) scored highest at 81 per cent for maintaining 13,344km of the targeted 16,580km of its road networks using the KRB fund distributes.

Even the counties, which usually perform poorly in road maintenance did better than the KeRRA with the devolved units achieving 68 per cent of its targeted 12,614km of roads for maintenance over the period.
The rural roads agency is the second-highest recipient of the multi-billion fund collected from fuel purchases yearly. It received Sh12.4 billion out of the Sh69 billion collected in the year to June 2019.
The KeNHA was allocated the highest at Sh23.6 billion from the fund due to its lengthy networks of roads under its watch.
The road agencies have recently been on the spot for failing to properly account for the multibillion levy for road maintenance, casting doubt on whether the funds are directed to the intended purposes, which is to keep roads in good shape.
