For most of 2020, our lives were disrupted by Covid-19. Lives have been lost, livelihoods disrupted and education adversely impacted.
Poverty levels have increased, societal bonds strained and the overall trend of development reversed.
Yet we have witnessed stories of hope, courage, triumph and kindness: The spirit of oneness — Ubuntu, Obuntubulamu or Utu — as is commonly known in East and Southern Africa regions.

The spirit of volunteerism, innate in all of us, is what drives the selfless people who have during the pandemic extended kindness to their neighbours, supported access to medical care for those in need, shopped for the elderly and other vulnerable people, among other acts of generosity.
This resonates with a statement by former UN secretary-general, the late Kofi Annan: “Behind the progress lie many factors. One is the willingness of many individuals to donate their time, effort, resources and ideas to the well-being and advancement of all. We call them volunteers.” 





Volunteers have been at the forefront of medical, community and societal responses across the East and Southern Africa region.
The Covid-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan developed by the WHO identifies community volunteers as key stakeholders for risk communication, community engagement and in provision of health services.
Contribution of volunteerism 
As countries move to build back better their socioeconomic foundations that have been greatly fissured by the pandemic, volunteers will play a vital role.
The UN says over a billion people are volunteers with many more willing to do so. If they constituted a country, they would be the fifth-largest.

The contribution of volunteerism to countries’ GDP cannot be underestimated. In Kenya, volunteerism contributes to about 3.6 per cent of the GDP according to research commissioned by the State Department for Social Protection in 2017.
Commemoration of the 2020 International Volunteer Day (IVD) recognised their contribution. In the region, governments, UN partners, academia, civil society and volunteer-involving organisations enumerated the benefits of volunteerism, like support to skilling where capacity gaps exist across the development context; support to service delivery, particularly in far-flung areas and ensuring no one is left behind in building community resilience.
Noting that volunteers at times work in challenging environments, they also advocated support and care for them. Anecdotes from volunteer-involving organisations showed that online volunteering works just as well as on-site volunteering, where extenuating circumstances limit the latter. 
Further evidence showed that the nimbleness of local volunteerism — flexibility, swiftness to act and the ability to self-organise — were attributes that came in handy in response to Covid-19.
With Covid-19 stretching the resilience of our communities, let us fight back by mobilising our volunteer spirits and overcome this pandemic.

} In his new year’s message to the country, the President called for a renewal of minds in the New Year 2021. He paraded the newly elected Msambweni MP Feisal Bader as the “firstborn” of the so called Hustler's Movement. Ever since Abiy Ahmed came to power, the Tigray regional government has been at odds with the central government.
