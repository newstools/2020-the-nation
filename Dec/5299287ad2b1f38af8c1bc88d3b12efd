The National Assembly passed the Anti-Doping (Amendment) Bill, 2020 on December 22 while the Senate passed it on Tuesday before it was presented to the President for signing on Thursday, beating the New Year's Day  deadline set to bar athletes from non-compliant countries from participating in international sporting competitions. The enactment of the law is expected to support the achievement of compliance by Kenya. Senate approved the Bill without amendments, paving the way for Presidential assent. In his new year’s message to the country, the President called for a renewal of minds in the New Year 2021. He paraded the newly elected Msambweni MP Feisal Bader as the “firstborn” of the so called Hustler's Movement. Ever since Abiy Ahmed came to power, the Tigray regional government has been at odds with the central government.
