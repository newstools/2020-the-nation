Police in Homa Bay have detained a 25-year-old trader after he allegedly killed his customer following a disagreement over Sh50 change.
Junior Opiyo, 23, was stabbed in the neck by a chips seller after he became impatient over a delay to give him his balance.
Mr Opiyo, who was accompanied by a group of friends, had gone to buy chips from the trader within Makongeni Estate in Homa Bay town on Tuesday evening when the incident happened.

});

}



The group is reported to have confronted the suspect after accusing him of being too slow.
After purchasing chips and giving out a Sh100 note, the buyers expected to be given a change of Sh50.
But the trader took long, which angered them.
Witnesses said the chips seller did not have the change.
He had to look for the money from other traders, which angered the customers, who complained that their time was being wasted.

Confronted trader
Mr Opiyo and his friends decided to confront the trader, who is then alleged to have used a kitchen knife that he was holding in his hands to stab the victim.
Asego Sub-location Assistant Chief Tom Ondiek said residents of Makongeni Estate called him, saying that a group of youths were fighting at a chips kiosk.
“I got to the scene and saw a youth being rushed to the hospital on a motorcycle. He was bleeding on is neck,” he said.
The victim died while being treated at St Paul’s Mission Hospital in Homa Bay Town.
The suspect was later arrested and taken to Homa Bay Police Station.
Homa Bay Sub-County Police Commander Sammy Koskey said the man will be charged with murder.
