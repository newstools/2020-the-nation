Between 1992 and 2017, the game of ballots and bullets claimed thousands of innocent lives, forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands and destroyed property worth billions.The 2010 Constitution ushered in an American-style pure presidential system. A decade after the 2010 Constitution came into force, Kenya’s transition is trapped. The country is yet to become an inclusive ‘developmental democracy’. In spite of that, its power elite is split over political reforms. But the train has left the station and the country is headed for a seismic referendum.

The pro-reform coalition has collected 5.2 million signatures, 4.2 million more than it needed to commence the referendum process on the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2020.
Since 2014, the World Bank has ranked East Africa’s economic, financial and transport hub as a lower middle-income country. Despite its growing entrepreneurial middle class, steady growth and robust regional and global leadership, political instability hangs like the Sword of Damocles over its dream of becoming an upper middle income economy by 2030.





Kenya’s power elite have herded the country’s roughly 48.5 million people into exclusive tribal ‘garrison constituencies’ with all the trappings of the Jamaican-style “garrison communities”: a nation impoverished by corruption, ready-for-war armed vigilante groups, blind support for local warlord politicians, exclusive development as part of an intricate client-patron system and cycles of ethnicity-based political turf wars and violence every election year.
Destroyed property
Between 1992 and 2017, the game of ballots and bullets claimed thousands of innocent lives, forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands and destroyed property worth billions.
After the calamitous double-elections on August 8 and October 26, 2017, the writing was on the wall for Kenya’s power elite: They had to reform the political system or end up with a failed nation. Even as Kenya’s transition is tragically trapped in the ‘politics of interregnum’ – where the old is dying and the new has refused to be born – its power elite is split on reforms.

Convinced they have circled the wagons around their challengers in the 2022 polls, the more populist and Machiavellian wing dismisses political reforms as a waste of energy, time and resources. Emboldened by the support of sections of Nairobi-based diplomatic community and civil society, the populists parody political stability as a luxury that can wait.
For their part, the idealists have drawn the red line in the sand. They insist reforms under the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) framework are unstoppable. The reformists have the state machinery and numbers in the national and county assemblies on their side. However, the idealists have to convince ‘Wanjiku’ – the wretched of the hamlet – that the repeal the 2010 ‘ceasefire’ Constitution is in her interest.
Intellectually, this calls for sober reflection and rethinking of the ‘democracy-development nexus’ in Kenya’s divided society.
After blissfully going full circle through the motions of all governance systems humanity has ever invented, Kenya has the hard experiential lessons it needs to make its choices. In 1963-1964, it had a short rendezvous with a British-style Westminster model, glazed with ethnic-based federalism. It then entered a long era of mixed government or semi-presidential system in 1969-2010.

Imperial presidency
This era of imperial presidency combined elements of parliamentary and presidential systems within the wider canvas of shades of authoritarianism, including a multi-party stint (1964-1969), a blistering one-party state (1969-1992), multi-party hiatus (1992-2007) and a mongrel power-sharing system that followed the 2007-2008 post-election mayhem.
The 2010 Constitution ushered in an American-style pure presidential system. But the 2017 electoral impasse exposed the serious “political stability deficit” in this ‘ceasefire document’. It couldn’t guarantee the political stability needed to undergird the effective delivery of Vision 2030, African Union agenda 2063, and the UN Millennium Development Goals.
The ringing message from Trump’s America is that countries across the world are trapped in unfinished transitions from archaic political systems and unable to reconcile between capitalist individualism and the populism of democracy.
Kenya’s reform process has to address the nexus between authoritarianism, democracy and development. The country’s experience over the past 57 years reveals three scenarios.
First, in the 1960s and 1970s, Kenya was part of what British scholar Tim Kelsall calls “authoritarian developers”. Like the Asian Tigers, it harnessed the developmental advantages of authoritarianism for rapid development.

Democracy
Second, after the 1970s, Kenya experienced authoritarianism without development. As the Kenyan Economist, Bethuel Kinuthia, rightly observes in a 2016 study, in the 1970s Kenya and Malaysia were comparable. But as Malaysia leaped forward and industrialised, Kenya was trapped in “authoritarian stagnation”.
Third, upon returning to a multiparty system in 1992, Kenya experienced a decade of “democracy without development”. The ‘Narc Revolution’ after 2002 ushered in democracy with some development. After 2010, Kenya devolved power and resources to the grassroots. Proposed reforms seek to devolve even more resources and responsibilities to the smallest political unit – the ward.





Despite these successes, the post-2010 constitutional order has failed to tame political instability and support ‘developmental democracy’.
That’s why the Constitution must be re-engineered to foster political stability and broad consensus among the power elite to tame corruption, uphold rule of law and consequently spur long-term socio-economic development. Trump repeatedly attacked mail-in voting, which was used more extensively by Democrats. They say withdrawing the students will undo strides made in higher education. The total number recoveries in the country now stands at 72,596.
