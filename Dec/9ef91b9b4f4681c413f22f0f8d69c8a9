A Nairobi court has acquited billionaire businessman Humphrey Kariuki in a case where he was charged with being in possession of 80 drums of uncustomed ethanol worth Sh7.4 million.
While acquitting the businessman on Tuesday, Senior Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot said the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has not availed evidence yet the case has been pending in court for 16 months.

Defence lawyers Kioko kilukumi, Cecil Miller and Philip Murgor had asked the court to invoke section 202 of the Criminal Procedure Code and acquit the accused.
"This court finds the DPP has not availed witnesses and l acquit the accused under section 202 of the CPC for want of prosecution," ruled Mr Cheruiyot.

Mr Kariuki, who is the proprietor of Africa Spirits Ltd and WOW Beverages Ltd, was charged after a consignment of 250-litre drums were found at Africa Spirits Ltd's premises following a raid in January last year.
