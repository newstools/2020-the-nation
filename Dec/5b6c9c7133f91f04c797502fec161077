Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Saturday said recent border skirmishes along the Ethiopia-Sudan border areas "will not break" the historic ties between the two neighbouring countries.
"The government is closely following the incident with local militia on the Ethio-Sudan border," Abiy said in a Twitter post, as he emphasised that "such incidents will not break the bond between our two countries as we always use dialogue to resolve issues".

"Those fanning discord clearly do not understand the strength of our historical ties," he added.
On Wednesday, the Sudanese army said Ethiopian militias attacked its forces on the border between the two countries.
"On Tuesday evening when our forces were about to finish combing the area around Jebel Abu Tiour inside our territories and return, they were ambushed by the Ethiopian militias," said the Sudanese army in a statement.





"There were losses in lives and equipment," the army added.
The border area between Sudan and Ethiopia often witnesses armed clashes by militias during the preparation for agricultural season. Uganda, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan have been experiencing internal conflicts. Sudan is hosting some 50,000 refugees who have fled fighting in Ethiopia's Tigray region. The African Union Commission has called for dialogue, citing Nairobiâ€™s contribution of troops to Amisom and the hosting of refugees. Regional leaders are expected to hold a meeting in Djibouti Sunday. The ANC leader has warned of a possible paralysis in the public service if primary focus remains on the BBI.
